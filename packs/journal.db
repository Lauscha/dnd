The widely spaced cities of the Sword Coast are arranged on a single great road like beads on a string. The road goes by several names as it winds over two thousand miles from Luskan in the north to Calimport in the south, passing through Neverwinter, Waterdeep, Baldur&#x2019;s Gate, and other great ports along the way. The first volume of <em>Tyranny of Dragons</em> took place largely on the stretch between Baldur&#x2019;s Gate and Neverwinter. This second volume takes the adventurers farther afield across the Sword Coast, preparing them for the final showdown against the servants of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a>.<br><br><strong><em>Adventure Supplements.</em></strong> You can play this adventure with just the Dungeons &amp; Dragons basic rules and the <em>Tyranny of Dragons</em> online supplement, which contains all the monsters and magic items not described in this book.

For most of that time, its focus has been on undead dragons, but that\u2019s changed. Now the cult seeks to act more directly and more boldly\u2014by summoning <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> out of the Nine Hells and bringing her bodily into the world. So far, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> and their leaders have gathered great stores of treasure, forged an alliance with Thay to assist with learning and performing the required summoning ritual, gathered up the five dragon masks central to the ritual (see \u201cDragon Masks,\u201d below), and persuaded or cajoled many of the oldest and strongest evil dragons of Faer\u00fbn into supporting them.<br><br>However, not everything has gone according to the cult\u2019s plans. The discovery of an alliance between the Cult of the Dragon and the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ODNjOWQ3ZDg0OTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Red Wizards of Thay</a> has shaken the various factions aligned against both organizations. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTVhZWIwYjMzYWJm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Harpers</a> view any such alliance as an abomination, as does <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=N2E2ZWY2NTkyZjkw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>the Order of the Gauntlet</a>. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Yjk2ZmRlNTg1MjI1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Lords' Alliance</a> recognizes the obvious threat to the lands and rulers of the Sword Coast and the North, while <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDdhYjQ2NTZlZDBi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>the Emerald Enclave</a> suspects that anything Thay promotes is likely against the natural order. Even <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjVjOWMxYWM1ZDgx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>the Zhentarim</a> fear the union of two such powerful forces. <br><br>News of the alliance has thus brought the various factions of the Sword Coast together. The leaders of those factions understand that they must gather and rally forces to fight the cult, even as the situation in Faer\u00fbn grows more dire. Abductions and raids undertaken by the Cult of the Dragon increase daily, and refugees are fleeing from burned-out regions under cult attack to major cities and fortresses. Villagers have abandoned their crops and herds, fleeing the constant predation of dragons.<br><br>In many cities, all-out panic has created a growing movement in favor of agreeing to the cult\u2019s demands in the hope of winning concessions in return. It is difficult to muster troops when people are afraid they will be burned by dragonfire. This is a time for heroes to inspire the people of the Sword Coast with a great victory or two. Fortunately, the Forgotten Realms has just such a group of heroes.<hr><h3>Dragon Masks</h3>The new leader of the cult is a Calishite named <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjAxNjhjN2VmZGVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Severin</a> Silrajin, who believes that real draconic knowledge and power belongs to living dragons, not undead ones. Severin\u2019s ambition amused <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a>, so she revealed the existence of five dragon masks to him\u2014one for each chromatic dragon color. Individually, these ancient masks allow wearers to communicate with dragons. More importantly, a character who is erudite in draconic lore becomes a wyrmspeaker while wearing the mask, which allows the wearer to think like a dragon, gain favor among dragons, and subtly influence their behavior. When all five are brought together, they magically merge into a single <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2IyZjNmNTc3NTYw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Mask of the Dragon Queen</a>. With the assembled mask, the cult can release Tiamat from her prison in the Nine Hells.<br><br>After <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjAxNjhjN2VmZGVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Severin</a> (subtly guided by Tiamat) discovered that secret, he bent all the cult\u2019s resources to finding the long-lost dragon masks in their secret hiding places. When he recovered the red mask, Severin became the first of the wyrmspeakers, but others soon followed. <br><br><h3>Secrets</h3>In the first volume of <em>Tyranny of Dragons</em>, the Cult of the Dragon gathered up a hoard for Tiamat\u2014then lost a portion of that hoard when Skyreach Castle fell. All the while, the cult kept secret its goal of bringing back <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> and its alliance with an exiled group of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ODNjOWQ3ZDg0OTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Red Wizards of Thay</a>. The cult now needs only to gather enough sacrifices to power the ritual by which the dragon masks will open a portal to the Nine Hells, allowing <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> to travel to the Material Plane. <br><br>These plans continue to move ahead as the Thayan exile <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzIxODNiZjM2MWIx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rath Modar</a> and his Red Wizards bring expertise in summoning magic to the cult, preparing a tremendous blood sacrifice to empower the ritual. <br><br>The alliance between wizards and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> is fragile, however, since neither side entirely trusts the promises of the other. <br><br><h3>Allied Forces</h3>This second volume of <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OGFkZjMxYTk0ODM3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Tyranny of Dragons</a></em> assumes that the factions of good-aligned adventurers and the people of the Sword Coast are aware of the threat posed by the cult. What\u2019s unclear is how to deal with it. Depending on the nature of the characters and their relationships with the factions, different groups might recommend different courses of action to the heroes. It falls to the players to figure out how they want to proceed.<br><br><h4>New Faces</h4>This adventure makes use of certain NPCs from <em>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</em>, and makes the assumption that those NPCs escaped any conflict with the adventurers. In the event that important nonplayer characters such as Wyrmspeaker <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTY3YmU0Mzg0NzBk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rezmir</a> or the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2VkMDk5ZmY0M2U2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Red Wizard</a> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzIxODNiZjM2MWIx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rath Modar</a> were killed or captured, simply replace them with new nonplayer characters here\u2014or assume that they were resurrected between the previous adventure and this one. Characters returning from the dead show the level of magical power the cult and its <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2VkMDk5ZmY0M2U2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Red Wizard</a> allies wield\u2014and their dedication to seeing Severin\u2019s plans brought to fruition.<br></section>", "img": ""}

The adventurers are summoned to Waterdeep for a summit that will come to be known as the Council of Waterdeep (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmYwYzA3Mzk1NzVm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Starting the Adventure</a> for details).<br><br>Four council sessions take place over the course of the adventure, naturally dividing events into four stages.

Others can be proposed by the characters. The adventurers understand that thousands of lives depend on their actions. The characters are among the greatest heroes of the Sword Coast, and the Council of Waterdeep looks to them for wise guidance and swift action.<br><br>Many of the power groups represented on the council don\u2019t trust each other, and some even have conflicting goals. Over the course of the council\u2019s four meetings, the players and characters need to forge this disparate, feuding group into a coordinated force. Only with all factions working together and contributing to the overall effort can enough power be brought to bear against the cult to prevent Tiamat\u2019s return. The more successful the characters are in their actions against the cult, the more esteem and influence they gain with the council.<br><br>Events are arranged in this book in a logical sequence for staging The Rise of Tiamat, and the episodes are numbered for ease of reference.

After discovering that <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGQ5NjU0MjAwZjli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Varram</a> is held captive by yuan-ti in the Serpent Hills, the characters can fight the yuan-ti and negotiate to take custody of the cultist.<br><br><strong><em>The Sea of Moving Ice.</em></strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGU2NWMzM2Q5OGJi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Maccath the Crimson</a>, a tiefling sorcerer of the Arcane Brotherhood, is an acknowledged expert on the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjM1NWY5NDNhOTlk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Draakhorn</a></em>\u2014an ancient relic being used by the cult to summon dragons to their cause. She disappeared three years ago in the Sea of Moving Ice, where she is presently a prisoner of the white dragon Arauthator. The characters must make their way to Arauthator\u2019s iceberg lair and convince Maccath to join them. By driving away the dragon and carrying off valuable dragon lore, they deal a blow to the cult and might gain the Arcane Brotherhood as allies in the process. <br><br><strong><em>The Cult Strikes Back (Part 1).</em></strong> The cult\u2019s leaders aren\u2019t oblivious to the damage being caused by the heroes. Assassins try to stop the characters\u2019 interference, but the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> misjudge the strength needed to complete the job.<br><br><h4>Stage 2 </h4><strong><em>Second Council of Waterdeep.</em></strong> The characters regroup with the leaders of the Sword Coast\u2019s factions at the Council of Waterdeep, assessing their victories over the cult and planning the factions\u2019 next moves.<br><br><strong><em>Neronvain.</em></strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDdhYjQ2NTZlZDBi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Emerald Enclave</a> requests that the adventurers help them investigate the aftermath of cult raids led by a green dragon in the Misty Forest\u2014a dragon possibly controlled by one of the cult\u2019s wyrmspeakers. That investigation leads to a showdown against the green dragon Chuth and Wyrmspeaker <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTY5YjAwZmZlZTI5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Neronvain</a>, who has a surprising connection to the council. <br><br><strong><em>Metallic Dragons, Arise.</em></strong> The metallic dragons of the Sword Coast send word to the Council of Waterdeep that they wish to participate in the coming struggle. The adventurers are chosen to attend a council of dragons in the Sunset Mountains, pleading the humanoid factions\u2019 case to some of the oldest and most powerful creatures in Faer\u00fbn. <br><br><strong><em>The Cult Strikes Back (Part 2).</em></strong> After a first attempt to assassinate the heroes failed, the Cult of the Dragon tries again. With a better idea of what they\u2019re up against, they have a better chance to succeed.<br><br><h4>Stage 3</h4><strong><em>Third Council of Waterdeep.</em></strong> At the third meeting of the Council of Waterdeep, the characters take lead roles in shaping the fight against the cult.<br><br><strong><em>Xonthal\u2019s Tower.</em></strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTRhOTg1ODUwZWM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Cult of the Dragon</a> is not without its own internal strife, as the adventurers discover when a cultist contacts them with the offer to turn over one of the dragon masks essential to Severin\u2019s plans. The characters must infiltrate a cult stronghold and claim the mask, then save a nearby village from the blue dragon that means to take the relic back.<br><br><strong><em>Mission to Thay.</em></strong> The ritual that will bring <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> to Faer\u00fbn is too complex for the cult\u2019s spellcasters to perform without their <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2VkMDk5ZmY0M2U2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Red Wizard</a> allies\u2014all Thayan exiles. The adventurers travel to Thay to forge an alliance with the Red Wizards, whose lich lord Szass Tam hungers for revenge against the exiles. The Red Wizards of Thay are evil to the core, though, and the delegates must tread carefully as they present their case.<br><br><strong><em>The Cult Strikes Back (Part 3).</em></strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTRhOTg1ODUwZWM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Cult of the Dragon</a> now knows the adventurers\u2019 strengths and methods. If the characters don\u2019t take precautions to safeguard themselves, the cult stands a good chance of killing them all with a third attack. <br><br><h4>Stage 4</h4><strong><em>Fourth Council of Waterdeep.</em></strong> At the final meeting of the council, the characters must work to unite the factions of the Sword Coast for the final battle against the Cult of the Dragon. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjAxNjhjN2VmZGVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Severin</a> is ready to fulfill his plans, and the combined forces of the Sword Coast must strike now if the cult is to be stopped.<br><br><strong><em>Tiamat\u2019s Return.</em></strong> At the Well of Dragons, a battle unfolds that will decide the fate of Faer\u00fbn. The factions of the Sword Coast fight alongside new and unexpected allies, facing off against the assembled might of the dragon <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a>, flights of chromatic dragons, other monsters, and mercenaries. The adventurers choose their own role during the battle, and might rescue sacrificial prisoners, shut down the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjM1NWY5NDNhOTlk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Draakhorn</a>, or take the lead in disrupting the magical ritual that will allow <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> to enter the world.<br><br><h4>Advancement</h4><em>Tyranny of Dragons: The Rise of Tiamat</em> was designed around the milestone system of advancement. At the start of the adventure, the characters should be 7th or 8th level. Instead of tracking specific experience awards, characters can level up at the completion of significant episodes of the adventure. The characters level up after every episode listed below:<br><ul><li>Episode 3: Death to the Wyrmspeakers (Varram)</li><li>Episode 2: The Sea of Moving Ice</li><li>Episode 5: The Cult Strikes Back (First Attack)</li><li>Episode 4: Death to the Wyrmspeakers (Neronvain)</li><li>Episode 5: The Cult Strikes Back (Second Attack)</li><li>Episode 7: Xonthal\u2019s Tower</li><li>Episode 8: Mission to Thay (level gain at DM\u2019s option)</li><li>Episode 5: The Cult Strikes Back (Third Attack)</li></ul>Leveling up after seven milestones should bring the characters to 14th or 15th level in time for the final battle at the Well of Dragons.<br></section>", "img": ""}

The party could be summoned by a factional leader seeking aid against the Cult of the Dragon, with the characters asked to undertake the \u201c<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGQ5NjU0MjAwZjli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Varram</a> the White\u201d portion of the \u201cDeath to the Wyrmspeakers\u201d episode. Seeking to capture a high-ranking cult leader is a great step in the fight against the cult. Once they return to Waterdeep, the adventurers then become embroiled in the first session of the \u201cCouncil of Waterdeep\u201d episode.<br><br><em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OGFkZjMxYTk0ODM3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Tyranny of Dragons</a></em> can be adapted to different regions of the Forgotten Realms, or to a different campaign setting entirely with a bit of preparation on your part. Change the names, factions, and locations present in the adventure to suit your own campaign.<hr><h2>Additional Encounters</h2><em>The Rise of Tiamat</em> is an open-framework adventure designed for higher-level characters. As such, not all your game sessions need to stick to the main track of the adventure narrative. Additional events, rumors, and encounters can be used as needed or added as side treks or distractions. The following encounter seeds are meant to be used when you want to break up the narrative or if the players get off track. Each can be expanded as you like, and is meant to tie into one of the main episodes in the adventure (or to let you gently guide the players in that direction). Each additional encounter also provides a sense of the wider scope of the setting.<br><br><h3>Monstrous Uprising</h3>A charismatic <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzZjYzVkMmQ4NDRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>half-red dragon veteran</a></strong> leads a band of 21 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWM0MWVmNDAyYzk0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>kobolds</a></strong> and 7 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjRiNWE4Y2QxYTVk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>lizardfolk</a></strong>, taking advantage of the unrest along the Sword Coast. The group might besiege a village the characters are staying at, raid and enslave another settlement, or start charging tolls along one of the trade roads of the Sword Coast. This band isn\u2019t organized enough to attack all at once and provide a significant challenge to the party. Instead, it shows the increasing anarchy of the region, and the way that Tiamat\u2019s rise has emboldened evil creatures that aren\u2019t directly serving the Dragon Queen.<br><br><h3>Power of the Cult</h3><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTRhOTg1ODUwZWM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Cult of the Dragon</a> expands its operation in larger and bolder ways. Its leaders send diplomatic missions to Berdusk, Triel, and other settlements demanding tribute\u2014and offering protection from dragon raids for those who comply. Cultists shake down caravans seeking protection money, and have been burning caravans that belong to the rivals of those who do pay. Less scrupulous merchants are finding it easier to do business with the cult than to fight against them. Any Zhentarim contacts of the adventurers are understandably worried about these developments. <br><br>Elite bands of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> have been charged with establishing the cult\u2019s control from the Gray Peaks to the Sunset Mountains. They seek out allies in the area, with an eye toward choosing friendly territory for a capital city and a seat of power for the cult\u2019s Inner Circle. Such bands are led by a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGUxMmJjYTlhNWI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonsoul</a></strong> defended by 4 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGUyYThmZWVlODkz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonclaws</a></strong> and a pack of 3 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTNjMzg3OWVkODNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guard drakes</a></strong>. The dragonsoul rides a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGU2ZjBkZmIzZTZj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>warhorse</a></strong>, but the other <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> are on foot.<br><br><h3>Devilish Demands</h3>Though the Cult of the Dragon and the Red Wizards are making use of diabolic allies as they plan the ritual that will free <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a>, not all devils are on their side. Some fiends not wanting to see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> gain worldly power seek to break the alliance between the cult and Thay. This encounter can be used to reveal to the characters the divisions already present among the evil factions.<br><br>The devils who are aligned against <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> send a delegation of 5 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a></strong> and 2 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDZkMDkwM2MzOWEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cult fanatics</a></strong> (devil worshipers) and a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NWE0OThmYmZlY2U0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>bone devil</a></strong> named Lord Volmer to treat with the party. The <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> lead the characters to a large tent, inside which Lord Volmer awaits. <br><br>Using telepathy, Lord Volmer tells the adventurers about the so-called \u201cThayan Resurrection\u201d (the attempt by Thayan exiles to supplant Szass Tam), as well as the fact that Szass Tam intends to destroy <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzIxODNiZjM2MWIx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rath Modar</a> and his \u201csplinter sect\u201d for their impudence. The bone devil assures the characters that they can earn the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ODNjOWQ3ZDg0OTdj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Red Wizards</a>\u2019 favor by providing him with information leading to Rath Modar\u2019s capture.<br><br>Lord Volmer also tells the party that the lords of the Nine Hells are divided when it comes to the matter of Tiamat\u2019s release. He tells the party that if <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> is prevented from escaping, the party will earn \u201cpowerful friends\u201d in the Nine Hells. If the characters attack Lord Volmer, he and his allies retaliate. The devil is not worried about dying, since he reforms at full strength in the Nine Hells upon his demise.<br><br><h3>Captive Cultist</h3>A group of dwarf miners has captured a high-ranking member of the Cult of the Dragon\u2014a Wearer of Purple named Cheela Flegsteel who got a little too greedy while leading a group of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> that was terrorizing the dwarves. Having killed Cheela\u2019s drakes and subordinates, the dwarves bring their prisoner to the adventurers hoping for a reward. <br><br>Cheela has useful information about the cult\u2019s activities, which could be used to lead into any episode of your choice. However, she also knows that a rescue party is not far behind her. The adventurers need to help the dwarves fend off an attack by 4 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTI0ODVkM2Y1NzU5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ogres</a></strong> and a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzZjYzVkMmQ4NDRi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>half-red dragon veteran</a></strong> named Yggran. The dwarves are hopelessly overmatched and flee rather than fight. If her fellow <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> can\u2019t save Cheela, they might kill her rather than leave her in the adventurers\u2019 hands.<br><br><h3>Fallen Hero</h3>The adventurers meet a seriously injured elf ranger\u2014a well-known hero named Cylanestriel. She speaks of her capture by the Cult of the Dragon and her escape from the stronghold at the caldera of the Well of Dragons. (If possible, make Cylanestriel an associate, mentor, or relative of someone in the party.)<br><br>Use this encounter to make the players aware of the dangers presented by a direct assault against the Well of Dragons. The army of the cult is huge and powerful enough to have destroyed a major adventuring group. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDFiYWZiMzgzMGZm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Well of Dragons</a> is on alert, and its defensive forces include flights of dragons that prowl the skies above the site. The characters should be made to understand that attacking with a large allied force is their only option for defeating the cult.<br><br><strong><em>Roll20 Note:</em> </strong>We suggest using a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGU2OTIwN2VkOWNj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>scout</a></strong> to represent Cylanestriel<br><br><h3>Death at the Council</h3>During the second or third session of the Council of Waterdeep, rumors spread of an aide from Neverwinter who killed an aide from Mithral Hall and then hanged himself. In truth, the Cult of the Dragon sent a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2ExYWY4NWVjNmZi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>succubus</a></strong> spy to Waterdeep. She charmed the Neverwinter aide into collecting information for her, but the other aide discovered their meetings. The succubus forced her victim to slay the other aide to cover her tracks, then to kill himself.<br><br>If the characters investigate, they can obtain the body to question it using <em>speak with dead</em>, or they might use <em>commune</em> to discover the spy. The succubus has gained another victim by that point\u2014a <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDA3Yzg1ODJiZGY3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>knight</a> of the Order of the Gauntlet who regularly goes to meet her at her slum dwelling in the Field Ward of Waterdeep. This pattern of murder and suicide continues unless the spy\u2019s true identity is discovered.<br></section>", "img": ""}

This book outlines the overall structure of the adventure and presents many episodes and events with which to challenge the characters as they investigate the nefarious plots of the Cult of the Dragon. This is not, however, a script to be read aloud with stage directions that must be followed. <em>Tyranny of Dragons</em> does not hold your hand and guide you step-by-step from the story\u2019s beginning to its inevitable conclusion. Instead, it presents people, creatures, locations, and situations for the adventurers to explore and interact with in a constantly changing, lively way. <br><br>You, the Dungeon Master, play a vital role. The creators of <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OGFkZjMxYTk0ODM3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Tyranny of Dragons</a></em> have tried to foresee the most likely courses of action that the characters might take in the adventure. However, D&amp;D players are curious and unpredictable, and Faer\u00fbn is immense and filled with possibility. In a scenario as open-ended as this one, it is all but guaranteed that at some point during the adventure\u2014and possibly at many points\u2014the players will develop their own ideas about how to handle a situation or how to deal with the cult. And just like that, they\u2019ll be off and running in directions that aren\u2019t covered by this book. Those kinds of situations put a DM\u2019s skill to the test\u2014but they also produce some of the greatest gaming moments and memories.<br><hr><strong><em>Roll20 Note</em>:</strong> All NPC's, monsters, poisons and other necessary stats are either linked directly in this module or available in our 5E Compendium.

During most of that time, its members have focused on the creation and worship of dracoliches, based on a prophecy translated by the cult\u2019s founder, Sammaster. However, those goals changed with the rise of a young cultist named <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjAxNjhjN2VmZGVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Severin</a>.<br><br>Inspired by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjAxNjhjN2VmZGVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Severin</a> reexamined the texts translated by Sammaster and discovered a different interpretation, believing that \u201cnaught will be left save shattered thrones, with no rulers but the dead. Dragons shall rule the world entire ... \u201d Severin\u2019s quest to reshape the cult led him to the dragon Hoondarrh, \u201cthe Red Rage of Mintarn.\u201d The fact that Severin not only survived this encounter but befriended the dragon impressed Tiamat in her exile in the Nine Hells. As a reward and further test, she allowed Severin a scrap of knowledge regarding the existence of the five dragon masks. Severin took that bit of information and did what few others could have accomplished, searching for and finding all five masks. The task took years to complete, and it led directly to the crisis that Faer\u00fbn now faces.<br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjAxNjhjN2VmZGVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Severin</a> kept the red mask for himself. As other masks were found, he presented them to his closest allies in the Cult of the Dragon, granting each the power of a wyrmspeaker. Using the magic of the dragon masks, this Inner Circle of Wyrmspeakers helps Severin prepare the way for Tiamat\u2019s return.<br><br><h3>Daily Operations</h3>The plots of the Cult of the Dragon are secret, but its existence is not. Most folk of the Sword Coast have heard of the cult, but know only that its members revere evil dragons. The cult recruits new members in major cities, and word quickly gets around. Moreover, many <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> engage in legitimate business or are assigned to ordinary academic research. Only a relative few serve as thieves, assassins, and spies. <br><br>Dragon-themed symbolism and iconography pervade the cult\u2019s official regalia\u2014black clothing that features a cape or cloak cut to resemble dragon wings, and festooned with jewelry and draconic imagery reflecting the wearer\u2019s favorite type of dragon. Masks are common at cult gatherings. <br><br>Cultists avoid this regalia in public, but a character who knows what to look for can often pick an incognito dragon cultist out of a crowd. Cultists sometimes greet one another with the sign of Tiamat: right hand extended, palm forward, with all five fingers spread in imitation of Tiamat\u2019s five heads. Characters trying to pass as <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> might find this sign useful if they don\u2019t overdo it. <br><br>Cult members venerate dragons as powerful icons and masters, but their worship is reserved for <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a>. They look forward to the Dragon Queen\u2019s return, believing that she will destroy mortal civilization and usher in a glorious reign of dragons\u2014and of those who helped bring about draconic rule. The complex plot dedicated to bring Tiamat to Faer\u00fbn has so far seen the cult recover the five dragon masks and collect an immense treasure worthy of the Dragon Queen. All that now remains is to raise her temple in the Well of Dragons, sacrifice hundreds of victims whose souls will power an ancient ritual, and then use that ritual to open a portal through which Tiamat will emerge from the Nine Hells.<br><br><h3>Cult Structure</h3>The cult has a simple hierarchical structure, consisting of initiates on the bottom, four ranks for <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a>, and one highest rank for \u201cWearers of Purple\u201d\u2014the lords, leaders, and cult masters of particular locales. The cult is ruled by a secretive inner group led by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjAxNjhjN2VmZGVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Severin</a> and four other wyrmspeakers\u2014a term of respect given to those whose bond with dragons is supernaturally strong. <br><br>Rank in the cult is based on merit and fanaticism. As raw recruits, initiates (represented by <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a></strong> and <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDZkMDkwM2MzOWEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cult fanatics</a></strong>) have no rank and follow the orders of their superiors. Only initiates that prove their worth are allowed to advance. A Wearer of Purple can promote an initiate along the track of <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGUyYThmZWVlODkz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonclaw</a></strong> (first rank), <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTMyYjE3ZWZmNzcw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonwing</a></strong> (second rank), <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmJkZTc1MWIwZDUx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonfang</a></strong> (third rank), and <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGUxMmJjYTlhNWI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonsoul</a></strong> (fourth rank).<br><br>Cult operation groups are assembled to match their assigned tasks. They vary in size, from a few low-ranking <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> operating on their own to hundreds of cultists of various ranks under the control of multiple Wearers of Purple. <br><br><h3>Wearers of Purple</h3>The Wearers of Purple stand at the top of the cult\u2019s humanoid hierarchy, and their word is law for the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> in the cities, strongholds, and lairs they command. They are the only members of the cult to wear purple, and most are proud enough to flaunt the color. The Wearers of Purple have an affinity for talking to and negotiating with dragons\u2014the gift of wyrmspeaking. Dozens of Wearers of Purple are spread throughout the Cult of the Dragon, and all are able to marshal the cult\u2019s resources.<br><br>Only Severin\u2019s inner circle can promote a dragonsoul to a Wearer of Purple, granting that character a base of operations and funds. Most new Wearers of Purple have already developed a working relationship with a dragon as part of their power and authority. Those who do not cultivate and expand this relationship are sometimes demoted. A number of priests of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> have recently been made Wearers of Purple, and have been charged with establishing temples for her open worship in Faer\u00fbn. This aspect of the cult\u2019s plans is still in the early stages, and the inner circle remains divided on how the Cult of the Dragon should interact with the faithful of Tiamat. <br><br><h3>The Inner Circle</h3>These four Wearers of Purple are the keepers of the dragon masks and Severin\u2019s most devoted servants in the effort to summon <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a>. Each of these wyrmspeakers bears one of the dragon masks, which they never part with except under the direst circumstances\u2014and then only at the request of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjAxNjhjN2VmZGVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Severin</a> or a draconic ally. The members of the inner circle each have an affinity for a particular color of chromatic dragon. They treat with dragons of those colors to recruit more dragons to the cause, and plan cult missions that advance Severin\u2019s plots. <br><br>In addition to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjAxNjhjN2VmZGVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Severin</a>, the Red Wyrmspeaker, the members of the inner circle are: <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NDZhZTcxZmM1YTNj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Galvan</a> (male human), the Blue Wyrmspeaker; <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTY5YjAwZmZlZTI5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Neronvain</a> (male moon elf), the Green Wyrmspeaker and son of Melandrach, King of the Misty Forest; <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTY3YmU0Mzg0NzBk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rezmir</a> (female half-black dragon), the Black Wyrmspeaker; and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGQ5NjU0MjAwZjli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Varram</a> (male dwarf), the White Wyrmspeaker. <br><br>If any wyrmspeakers are killed or captured in your campaign\u2014including <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTY3YmU0Mzg0NzBk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rezmir</a>, who the characters might have defeated in Hoard of the Dragon Queen\u2014Severin appoints new followers to his inner council.<br><br><h3>Dissent in the Ranks</h3>Under Severin\u2019s leadership, most <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> are devoted to Tiamat\u2014but not all. Some of the old guard dislike the cult\u2019s new direction, and long for the established traditions and the rise of the dracoliches. A common thought among the dracolich loyalists is that <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjAxNjhjN2VmZGVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Severin</a> is being played by the fiendish <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a>. Notable among these members of the old guard are <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODVjYjVjZTIzNjE3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Naergoth Bladelord</a>, the former commander of the stronghold at the Well of Dragons, and Jorgen Pawl and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YmIxNzY0YjIyZjEz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Iskander</a>, two high-ranking <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> in command of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2IzMmZhZDlmYjgz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Xonthal\u2019s Tower</a>.<br><br><h3>Using the Cult of the Dragon</h3>Cultists are suitable foes for the adventurers in most situations. They keep a low profile in public, so characters are unlikely to see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> in full regalia on the streets of Waterdeep or Scornubel. As their plots near fruition, however, the cultists grow bolder and might engage the adventurers openly. <br><br>By the start of <em>The Rise of Tiamat</em>, the effects of the cult\u2019s activities are visible across the Sword Coast. The scorched ruins of farming communities pillaged by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> for Tiamat\u2019s hoard are a common enough occurrence that travelers know something is amiss.<br></section>", "img": ""}

A grim, dismal region spread across a towering plateau, Thay is defended by an army of undead warriors and ruled by the lich Szass Tam and the zulkirs he appoints to rule over the eight schools of magic. The Red Wizards of Thay are known across Faer\u00fbn, and are easily recognized by their distinctive crimson robes and the arcane sigils tattooed onto their shaved heads. Because of their evil reputation, Red Wizards are arrested or killed on the spot in many lands. For that reason, they often travel in disguise, invisibly, or by magical means. <br><br>For many years, Szass Tam\u2019s grip on absolute power in Thay has been weakened by internal strife. Mortal Red Wizards have risen against their undead masters, destroying some of Szass Tam\u2019s lich zulkirs and thinning the ranks of other undead. Little is known of the conflict beyond Thay\u2019s borders, however. In this quiet civil war, both sides fear that too much attrition will make Thay a target for its long list of enemies. Szass Tam questions the allegiance of all living Red Wizards outside Thay, and has made it clear that death and worse await any who oppose him.<br><br><h3>Rath Modar\u2019s Ambition</h3>One such <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2VkMDk5ZmY0M2U2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Red Wizard</a> exile is <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzIxODNiZjM2MWIx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rath Modar</a>, an illusionist of great skill who long ago made the Sword Coast his home. Having a natural interest in dragons, it wasn\u2019t long before Rath Modar came into contact with the Cult of the Dragon and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjAxNjhjN2VmZGVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Severin</a>. The young, ambitious cult leader sought powerful magic to locate the scattered dragon masks and to perform the ritual that would summon <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> from the Nine Hells. Rath Modar dreamed of an army that could confront and defeat Szass Tam. Out of mutual need, their alliance was born.<br><br>The secret cornerstone of this union is Rath Modar\u2019s belief that once <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> returns, she will see that the Red Wizards are more useful allies than the devoted but magically weak <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a>. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzIxODNiZjM2MWIx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rath Modar</a> hopes that Tiamat will show her gratitude for the pivotal role he and his fellow Red Wizards played in her return, granting them an army of dragons with which to assault Thay. After unseating Szass Tam, Rath Modar plans to take his place at the head of all Red Wizards. Whether Tiamat will grant such a reward\u2014or have any further use for the Red Wizards at all\u2014remains unknown.<br><br>Not all members of the Cult of the Dragon are happy about the Red Wizards\u2019 involvement in the cult\u2019s plans. Wyrmspeaker <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGQ5NjU0MjAwZjli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Varram</a> foresees trouble in the cult joining forces with Rath Modar\u2019s splinter sect. He has warned <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjAxNjhjN2VmZGVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Severin</a> about the potential danger, to no avail. <br><br><h3>Using the Red Wizards</h3>Red Wizards can be encountered anywhere on the Sword Coast (use <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjljM2ZhMDgwYzQ2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mage</a></strong> stats if necessary), whether operating alongside <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> or on their own. They most often work alone, but two or three Red Wizards might join forces for an important assignment. In a public area where their appearance could put them at risk, Red Wizards favor deep hoods and scarves to hide their faces. Their undead <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzY4ZmViZjYxMDdi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wight</a></strong> bodyguards are usually nearby\u2014and often invisible. Each <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2VkMDk5ZmY0M2U2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Red Wizard</a> specializes in a single school of magic, but all learn spells outside their specialty schools. <br>Red Wizards don\u2019t share the cultists\u2019 fanaticism for <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a>. For them, bringing the Dragon Queen into the world is just one stage of what they call the Thayan Resurrection\u2014the larger plan to destroy Szass Tam and reclaim Thay. They tolerate the dragon cultists but do not acknowledge them as equals.<br><br>Not every <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2VkMDk5ZmY0M2U2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Red Wizard</a> on the Sword Coast is working for <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzIxODNiZjM2MWIx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rath Modar</a> or the Cult of the Dragon. Some pursue their own interests, while others are spies for Szass Tam. The adventurers might thus find themselves making uneasy alliances with characters they would normally never trust, since the easiest and surest way to eliminate a Red Wizard in service to the cult is to betray that wizard\u2019s location to an agent of Szass Tam. However, characters who get too close to Szass Tam\u2019s servants and his paranoid vendetta against the Red Wizard exiles might find themselves at the mercy of the Thayans. This possibility is explored more fully in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjQyMWE0Njk3ZGNk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Enemy of My Enemy</a>.<br></section>", "img": ""}
{"_id": "N2Y3NTJlODM0YTNh", "name": "Hosts of the Nine Hells", "permission": {"default": 0}, "folder": null, "flags": {"R20Converter": {"handout-order": 3, "handout-archived": false}}, "sort": 30000, "entryTime": 0, "content": "\n<section class=\"secret\"><p>GM Notes : </p><h2>Hosts of the Nine Hells</h2><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> has long threatened Faer\u00fbn, often appearing in lands such as Chessenta and Unther to drive mortals to worship her awesome power. Although mortals don\u2019t know it, the end of the Sundering and the Era of Upheaval also put an end to such direct meddling by the gods. Without powerful magic and mortal aid, Tiamat cannot travel from her home in Avernus into the world. <br><br>Avernus is a boulder-strewn desolation where fiery comets streak across the sky and devil aristocrats rule from dismal iron fortresses. The River Styx saws a jagged course through Avernus\u2019s basalt cliffs, winds its way across ashen plains, and eventually plunges through a yawning pit into the eight levels of the Hells below. All the rivers of Avernus feed into the Styx, each one flowing red with blood beneath a roiling cloud of flies. <br><br>Asmodeus recently reinstated the fallen angel Zariel as the Archduchess of Avernus, reversing an earlier decision that allowed a pit fiend named Bel to take the throne. While in exile from her seat of power, Zariel was at the mercy of Tiamat\u2014a fate that rankles her still. Despite her power as ruler of the first layer of the Nine Hells, Zariel cannot kill the dragon goddess, and she sees the summoning of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> to the world as a way to be rid of her. <br><br>Zariel has directed her mortal agents to assist those who seek to free <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a>, and her power has made it easier for the Red Wizards to summon devils and for the Cult of the Dragon to find more adherents. However, just as Zariel wants Tiamat out, other devils would be happy to see the Dragon Queen stay in Avernus. Foremost among them is the deposed pit fiend Bel and the devils still loyal to him.<br><br>Ordinarily, the Cult of the Dragon has nothing to do with devils. However, releasing <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> into the world is a massive undertaking, and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjAxNjhjN2VmZGVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Severin</a> has called on every resource he can. Though many of his allies among the Red Wizards are well schooled in summoning and commanding devils, doing so is never a straightforward process. Devils cannot leave the Nine Hells of their own accord, and though Asmodeus can bend these laws, he seldom does. Most devils in the Material Plane were summoned there by mortal <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjljM2ZhMDgwYzQ2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mages</a> who expended tremendous amounts of magical power to breach the barriers that separate the Nine Hells from other planes. <br><br><h3>Using Devils</h3>Devils aren\u2019t numerous in <em>The Rise of Tiamat</em> until the final showdown at the Well of Dragons, but their presence elsewhere in the adventure (including the additional encounter \u201cDevilish Demands\u201d in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTUxMjhjYTdjYjI3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Adventure Hooks</a>) should make attentive players wonder at the connection between devils and dragons. Devils are supreme manipulators, and if the characters have the opportunity to speak with devils that aren\u2019t working for the cult, don\u2019t be afraid to offer them diabolical assistance. Such an offer should put all characters\u2014not just those of good alignment\u2014in a bind. Bargaining with devils is a fool\u2019s game, but if the alternative is the end of the world, it might be the adventurers\u2019 only option.<br><br>Devils in the adventure should always be one step ahead of the adventurers. Characters who like to charge in and decide on strategy later will find that their diabolical foes have well-executed plans. If the characters plan two steps ahead, the devils are one step beyond that. Nothing mortals do should ever surprise them. <br></section>", "img": ""}

However, chromatic dragons are notoriously arrogant, territorial, greedy, and suspicious of any creatures begging favors&#x2014;especially if those creatures might be a threat. Getting dragons to cooperate is a monumental task, even when bringing the Queen of Dragons into the world is the ultimate goal.<br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTRhOTg1ODUwZWM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Cult of the Dragon</a> has a secret weapon for dealing with chromatic dragons, in the form of the five dragon masks. Even with a dragon mask, the process of influencing a dragon remains arduous and dangerous&#x2014;though the payoff is enormous. These relics give their wearers the ability to communicate with dragons, but more importantly, they impart a subtle influence over dragons that cannot be detected. Dragons cannot be controlled by the masks, but they can be swayed by ideas and proposals that they would not normally find persuasive.<br> <br><h3>Using Chromatic Dragons</h3>The power of the chromatic dragons is a motif running through every aspect of <em>Tyranny of Dragons: The Rise of Tiamat</em>. As the events of the adventure unfold, more and more dragons respond to the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjM1NWY5NDNhOTlk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Draakhorn</a></em>&#x2019;s rumbling moan and journey to the Well of Dragons&#x2014;a migration that inspires alarm and panic in people across Faer&#xFB;n. <br><br>Characters and players should seldom be allowed to forget that the evil dragons are on the move. Whenever the adventurers are outside, they might see a dragon winging overhead in the distance. The shadow of a dragon could fall across the adventurers in the daytime, and dark draconic wings might momentarily blot out the moon at night. When the characters arrive in a settlement, they should hear stories about dragon sightings and attacks. When they travel, burned-out hamlets and demolished caravans line the road. <br><br>Dragons are among the oldest, most intelligent, and most powerful monsters in Faer&#xFB;n and the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. Chromatic dragons are evil and merciless, and every battle against these creatures should be a life-or-death struggle. No dragon should ever fall without the heroes suffering during the battle. Chromatic dragons use every possible advantage with no regard for fairness, and their chief advantage is flight. A dragon never fights on foot where enemies might hack at it when it can soar majestically out of reach and slaughter foes with its breath weapon. Only in its lair will a dragon typically engage in melee, and then only if its hoard is threatened. <br><br>Characters who can tackle the challenges of this adventure are high enough level to have allies raised from the dead when those allies fall to a draconic foe. If the characters can&#x2019;t do so themselves, their allies in the Order of the Gauntlet or the Harpers should be willing to help out. <br><br>With lifetimes of a thousand years or more to lose, chromatic dragons have no interest in dying in battle against mere humanoids, and they don&#x2019;t sacrifice themselves nobly for any cause&#x2014;Tiamat included. A dragon caught in a losing battle takes any escape that presents itself, most often simply soaring away. This changes during the final showdown at the Well of Dragons, however, when <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> can be seen clawing her way through the portal from the Nine Hells. <br></section>", "img": ""}

Bearers of the gauntlet are holy warriors on a righteous quest to crush evil and promote justice, and they never hide in the shadows. Evil must be opposed openly and vanquished in the light of day, so that all can see and be emboldened by its destruction.<br><br>Members of the order are driven by religious fervor and by devotion to the principle of justice for all. Whether a member places more emphasis on one or the other of those ideals is an individual choice. Camaraderie and esprit de corps run high within the order, and an individual member will risk anything to save a fellow member or to complete an important mission. <br><br>The Order of the Gauntlet is a young organization, and it is eager and restless for action. It does not take orders from any government or temple, although the opinions of holy figures are greatly esteemed within the order. When evil threatens, the gauntlet strikes. <br><br><h3>Using the Order of the Gauntlet</h3>The Order of the Gauntlet is an invaluable asset at the final showdown at the Well of Dragons. No other faction can muster more paladins and priests to heal the wounded and combat Severin\u2019s devil allies directly. <br><br>Before the final battle, members of the order make interesting NPCs for roleplaying encounters because of their outgoing ways and strong opinions. Sharing a roadside inn with twenty paladins from the Order of the Gauntlet, or joining their march for a few days when headed in the same direction, should be a memorable experience. <br><br>Clerics, paladins, and monks make up the majority of the Order of the Gauntlet, but any character of a righteous mind is welcome in the order\u2019s ranks. <br><br><h3>Ontharr Frume</h3><em>Lawful good male human paladin</em><br><strong>Ideals:</strong> Responsibility, greater good (\u201cThe strong must defend the weak, whatever the cost.\u201d)<br><strong>Personality Traits:</strong> Friendly, hot-tempered<br><strong>Pledged Resources:</strong> Paladins and healing clerics to support the fight against Tiamat\u2019s forces<br><br>Boisterous and gregarious to a fault, Ontharr is the leading delegate for the Order of the Gauntlet. He has all the justification he needs to support the party (especially if the characters played through <em>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</em>). However, the rest of the order is not yet convinced. In particular, the order does not tolerate evil, and if the characters are known to have committed acts of a dubious moral nature, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzOTBlMDQ3OTRj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Ontharr Frume</a> will be pressured to withhold his support. Members of the order will seek proof that the party is righteous or has divine guidance, for it is only with the blessing of Torm and the other gods that <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> can be defeated.<br><br>Just as good deeds must be performed in the light for all to see, evil must be shunned and fought at every turn. Members of the order can be won over by heroic and righteous deeds, but they will turn against characters who cooperate with or tolerate evil. The order can best be swayed by actions that demonstrate heroism and divine providence\u2014uniting the metallic dragons to fight Tiamat\u2019s brood, for example. Slaying a wyrmspeaker will also serve the party well, while capturing and delivering such a villain to justice will raise them even higher in the order\u2019s sight.<br><br>Ontharr Frume\u2019s dedication to heroic justice creates a strong connection between him and the paladin <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Mzc1OGY3OWZlOWEx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Sir </a><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Mzc1OGY3OWZlOWEx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Isteval</a>. However, Ontharr has difficulty reconciling the heroic Isteval of legend with the diplomatic and retiring figure of the Council of Waterdeep. It\u2019s incomprehensible to him why Sir Isteval does not take to the field himself in this great conflict.<br></section>", "img": "modules/mod-rise-of-tiamat/journal/000_-_START_HERE/009_-_Allies/002_-_The_Order_of_the_Gauntlet/avatar.png"}

Members of the enclave live in the wilderness or in small communities, and the order has almost no representatives in towns and cities. They are not opposed to civilization, however. Rather, they seek to prevent civilization and wilderness from harming one another. Those who serve the Emerald Enclave are masters of survival and living off the land, of navigating through the wilderness, and of reading the signs that indicate approaching weather, the passage of creatures, and the general weal of the natural world. <br><br>Severin&#x2019;s plan to release <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> from the Nine Hells represents a grave threat to the natural order. The Dragon Queen&#x2019;s reign and the ascendancy of chromatic dragons would trigger a continent-wide catastrophe that the Emerald Enclave cannot allow.<br><br><h3>Using the Emerald Enclave</h3>Members of the Emerald Enclave operate alone or in small groups. Their primary focus is places where the natural world and civilization intersect, because that&#x2019;s where the natural order is most easily upset. Humanoids and monsters alike can become a threat to nature when they are thrown out of balance with their environment or their role in the world. <br><br>Whenever characters are traveling through the wilderness&#x2014;and especially if they get into trouble in a remote area&#x2014;they can encounter agents of the Emerald Enclave. If the adventurers need someone to guide them safely across a mountain range or lead them through trackless, monster-infested forest, there is no better choice than a member of the order. <br><br>Druids, rangers, and barbarians make up most of the Emerald Enclave, but any character with a strong affinity for nature can find a place in the order. <br><br><h3>Delaan Winterhound</h3><em>Neutral good male half-elf ranger</em><br><strong>Ideals:</strong> Balance, life (&#x201C;In all good hearts is a spot of darkness, and in all tragedy is a glimmer of light.&#x201D;)<br><strong>Interaction Traits:</strong> Quiet<br><strong>Pledged Resources:</strong> Druids, treants, and good- and neutral-aligned lycanthropes<br><br>Delaan has come to the Council of Waterdeep as the lone representative of the Emerald Enclave. Even his regular companion, a winter wolf named Loska, remains on patrol outside the city. Delaan spends much of his time wandering the northern wilderness, and although he visits friends in Nesm&#xE9; once a year, he otherwise shies away from large settlements. He is clearly uncomfortable in Waterdeep.<br><br>There is no question that <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> must be stopped, but the Emerald Enclave wants to see the world restored to order. This sometimes means taking a middle ground in battles between good and evil. Delaan is acutely aware of the destruction accompanying the recent activities of the Cult of the Dragon. He knows the cult must be destroyed for upsetting the balance of nature, and he knows that many dragons supporting the cult will die before the end. He would rather not kill unnecessarily, however. <br><br>Delaan is initially reserved in his support of the party. To earn his respect, the characters must recognize that their battle is not just to save civilization but to preserve the natural order. He thus objects to many actions that good or neutral characters might not think twice about&#x2014;including destroying chromatic dragon eggs and other acts that disrupt the natural cycle. <br><br>Delaan&#x2019;s oldest friend and mentor is a mighty <strong>treant </strong>named Turlang who resides in the High Forest. With Delaan&#x2019;s support, many treants will join the fight against <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a>.<br></section>", "img": "modules/mod-rise-of-tiamat/journal/000_-_START_HERE/009_-_Allies/003_-_The_Emerald_Enclave/avatar.png"}

Common folk know the Zhentarim as the people to talk to when you need the best <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzIyOTU3OTAzY2Vl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guards</a> or mercenaries money can buy. And if the cargo is shady or the cause you&#x2019;re fighting for is questionable or even unjust, the Zhentarim don&#x2019;t mind. <br><br>Affiliation with the Zhentarim can be profitable to sellswords, thieves, and rogues of every stripe. It&#x2019;s plausible that adventurers in your campaign might become members of the organization&#x2014;but like most residents of Faer&#xFB;n, they won&#x2019;t know the full extent of the Zhentarim&#x2019;s operations and goals. <br><br>Unknown to all but a few, the heart of the Zhentarim is a cabal of evil and sometimes monstrous leaders who seek to extend the Black Network&#x2019;s blood-soaked reach into every assassination, black market, and illegal deal that happens in Faer&#xFB;n. The order&#x2019;s criminal connections burrow into every major city and thieves&#x2019; guild in the Western Heartlands and along the Sword Coast. Wherever a city&#x2019;s coinage is disastrously undermined by counterfeiting, wherever an up-and-coming business runs roughshod over its established competitors, and wherever a political struggle turns to widespread intimidation, it&#x2019;s a safe bet that the Zhentarim are involved.<br><br>However, engaging in mainstream corruption and wanting to see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> ascendant are two different things. The Zhentarim have no illusions about what the Dragon Queen&#x2019;s return would mean for their plans. Wanting to secretly rule the world from the shadows for themselves, the leaders of the Black Network have no desire to become agents and errand-runners for some petty god and her dragon cohorts. <br><br>This viewpoint makes the Zhentarim an interesting addition to the characters&#x2019; possible allies. Under normal circumstances, the Harpers, the Lords&#x2019; Alliance, the Order of the Gauntlet, and the Emerald Enclave would shun ties to the Black Network&#x2014;and possibly arrest its emissaries. However, the crisis created by the Cult of the Dragon is unprecedented. Every resource that can be mustered will be needed in the final showdown against the cult, and the Zhentarim&#x2019;s network of spies, assassins, and mercenary armies cannot be ignored. <br><br>Even with the fate of the world and the Zhentarim&#x2019;s own future hanging in the balance, the order demands payment for services&#x2014;and where need and risk are greatest, the pay is expected to be equally great. This mercenary attitude does not sit well with the Lords&#x2019; Alliance, however, and they are the only group with the resources to pay the Black Network&#x2019;s price. The heroes can attempt to sway the opinions of the other factions&#x2014;and have a chance to buy the Zhentarim&#x2019;s allegiance outright in the follow-up to Xonthal&apos;s Tower in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OTNlYzRlYzc3MmI2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Fourth Session</a> of the Council.<br><br>In the end, too much is at stake to sit this fight out, and the Zhentarim pitch in against the cult regardless of whether their price is paid. However, if the other factions want a voice in how the Zhentarim go to war against the cult, it will cost them. If the Zhentarim fight on their own, they strike when and how they choose. <br><br>At least one Black Network mission is carried out regardless of payment. Without the knowledge of anyone outside the Zhentarim, one of their agents has infiltrated the cult and gets close enough to Wyrmspeaker <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGQ5NjU0MjAwZjli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Varram</a> to steal the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Njk2YjlhMTQ4NGVh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>White Dragon Mask</a>. This theft sets off a sequence of events that culminates in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YTE2ZTdmYTlkMmIz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Episode 3: Varram the White</a>. <br><br><h3>Using the Zhentarim</h3>Black Network agents are useful NPCs that you can introduce at appropriate times during the adventure. Characters who played Hoard of the Dragon Queen have already met one member of the Black Network&#x2014;the female gnome <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NmEzMjcyMDE0NzYy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Jamna Gleamsilver</a>. If the characters need information or gear they can&#x2019;t obtain any other way, seeking out or being approached by a Zhentarim agent is an easy way for you to provide it.<br><br>A typical Black Network agent is a highly capable adventurer with no scruples. Some Zhentarim have winged snake companions that carry messages on scrolls as they fly, allowing agents to keep in contact with one another. <br><br>Although the Zhentarim as a whole oppose the cult&#x2019;s plans, not everyone in the Black Network shares that view. A number of Zhentarim agents believe that the cult&#x2019;s victory is inevitable, and that by standing against the cult, the Zhentarim risk losing everything. If events are going too smoothly for the heroes, you can introduce a few rogue Black Network agents to throw a wrench into the characters&#x2019; plans at the worst possible moment.<br><br><h3>Rian Nightshade</h3><em>Lawful evil female tiefling warlock</em><br><strong>Ideals:</strong> Logic, greed (&#x201C;I&#x2019;m certain we can come to an agreement that all parties will favor. But if not, we have other means of settling the issue.&#x201D;)<br><strong>Interaction Traits:</strong> Polite, mercantile, ruthless<br><strong>Pledged Resources:</strong> Assassins and mercenaries<br><br>Rian is a member of the Zhentarim and the Black Network&#x2019;s envoy during the third Council of Waterdeep. She is seated at the table as a special adviser to Lord Neverember, and her affiliation with the Zhentarim will not be mentioned. However, neither she nor Lord Neverember try to deny or conceal that affiliation if the characters question why Rian is present.<br><br>The Black Network backs any plans that increase the likelihood of defeating the cult. Any and all alliances are fine, as are any outcomes that add to the council&#x2019;s strategic resources. Rian doesn&#x2019;t have any particular interest in morality, and dark acts have no impact on her attitude toward the party. She disapproves of taking any wyrmspeakers alive, though, fearing the power of such dangerous figures and questioning the chance of success for attempts to turn or interrogate them. She favors discreet execution, interrogation of the corpse with appropriate rituals, and destruction of the body to prevent resurrection.<br><br>The Black Network remains uncommitted until the final council when pledges are made. If the party has earned the Zhentarim&#x2019;s respect, they provide their services at only a nominal cost. However, such action almost certainly alienates most of the other factions from the adventurers. Unlike the other factions, the Zhentarim&#x2019;s loyalty can be purchased regardless of their respect for the characters, if the party can negotiate terms to be paid by the other factions.<br></section>", "img": "modules/mod-rise-of-tiamat/journal/000_-_START_HERE/009_-_Allies/004_-_The_Zhentarim/avatar.png"}

This organization was created and is led by leaders and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTY5MmZhNzZjYjEx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>nobles</a> from across Faer\u00fbn. Although many of its members have conflicting goals and long-standing rivalries outside the alliance, they band together in the face of events that are too big for any of them to handle on their own. The rulers of Waterdeep, Silverymoon, Baldur\u2019s Gate, and other cities, families, and trading houses of the Sword Coast might never set aside their differences, but they can pull together when the survival of all depends on it. <br><br>The Lords\u2019 Alliance represents the richest interests and the most powerful armies on the Sword Coast. The order controls wealth that can hire mercenaries, ensure the loyalty of wavering princes, and possibly even bribe a few chromatic dragons to switch sides or break from Tiamat\u2019s cause. Without the help of the alliance against the Cult of the Dragon, the Dragon Queen\u2019s victory might be assured. <br><br><h3>Using the Lords\u2019 Alliance</h3>Even while they are working together, members of the Lords\u2019 Alliance are always advancing their own interests. Everyone knows and expects it\u2014it\u2019s a fact of dealing with the alliance. That doesn\u2019t mean member cities don\u2019t cooperate and help each other in times of crisis. But if a crisis rearranges the power structure of the Sword Coast, all the players involved hope that the new order leaves them better off. For anyone to move up, someone else must move down. <br><br>Whenever a military campaign is underway, the Lords\u2019 Alliance is likely to be in command. Even if it isn\u2019t, alliance representatives will be on hand to observe and advise. If the characters find themselves in legal trouble, a councilor might come to the party\u2019s aid with a writ of pardon.<br><br>Fighters and sorcerers are plentiful in the Lords\u2019 Alliance, but the order takes on any character who feels at home in civilized lands. Barbarians, rangers, and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzE2OGQ0NTI1MzVh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>druids</a> are seldom involved with this faction, which sometimes leads to strained relations with the Emerald Enclave.<br><br><h3>On the Council</h3>Because the Lords\u2019 Alliance is a confederation, the order sends seven delegates to the Council of Waterdeep, each effectively representing his or her own faction. Their diverse character, motivations, and obligations ensure that they are not in agreement about the current threat facing Faer\u00fbn. Moreover, the standing of certain delegates changes from one council to the next.<br><br>Although it is not necessary for all delegates to back the adventurers, without at least some support from the Lords\u2019 Alliance, there is almost no way for the party to marshal enough forces to win the day. <br><br><h3>Lady Laeral Silverhand</h3><em>Chaotic good female human wizard</em><br><strong>Ideals:</strong> Creativity, respect (\u201cWe cannot stop what we do not understand.\u201d)<br><strong>Interaction Traits:</strong> Quiet, curious<br><strong>Pledged Resources:</strong> Waterdeep\u2019s army and conscript troops<br><br>Lady Laeral is present starting with the second council, at which point she becomes the Open Lord of Waterdeep. She is one of the Seven Sisters\u2014legendary, nigh-immortal figures known to have been blessed by Mystra. (Some even say they are the goddess\u2019s daughters.) Her spellcasting ability is impressive but is beginning to wane, and she focuses more on political power than on the arcane these days. The Masked Lords of Waterdeep choose her as the successor to Dagult Neverember between the first and second sessions of the Council of Waterdeep, making her the leader of the Lords\u2019 Alliance. <br><br>Laeral Silverhand brings centuries of leadership experience and an impressive reputation to the negotiations. A consummate diplomat, she can wield words that wound or soothe with equal ease. As the Open Lord of Waterdeep, she holds great sway with all the delegates except Dagult Neverember, who believes that she engineered his removal from the position of Open Lord.<br><br>Laeral\u2019s primary concern is keeping all parties at the negotiating table, and making sure that concrete actions result from each council\u2019s discussions. However, she is leery of committing troops to battle. No stranger to the horrors of war, she is keenly aware that the lands represented by the Lords\u2019 Alliance need their soldiers for the protection of their own people. Only when convinced that the Cult of the Dragon is likely to succeed in summoning <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a> does she change her mind. However, she doesn\u2019t trust the adventurers with leadership unless their deeds in the field and at the negotiating table have impressed her.<br><br>If the adventurers sway Laeral to their side, she speaks highly of the party in the periods between council sessions. Having the support of the leader of the Lords\u2019 Alliance increases the party\u2019s stature in the eyes of all other factions, granting additional bonuses. See episode 1 and the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2Q2YzQ3YjAyMjcz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Council Scorecard Rules</a> for more information.<br><br><h3>Lord Dagult Neverember</h3><em>Lawful neutral male human fighter</em><br><strong>Ideals:</strong> Moderation, responsibility (\u201cThe commoners need strong leaders to protect them\u2014and to do what must be done even when it is distasteful.\u201d)<br><strong>Interaction Traits:</strong> Honest<br><strong>Pledged Resources:</strong> Neverwinter conscript troops, and mercenaries from around the world<br><br>Lord Neverember holds many titles and wears several crowns. During the first council, he is the Open Lord of Waterdeep, the Lord Protector of Neverwinter, and leader of the Lords\u2019 Alliance. He looks the part of such an impressively titled figure: tall and broad-shouldered, with a thick beard, a wild mane of hair, and a forceful manner. Rarely seen without his hand around a glass of strong spirits, he is a master manipulator and looks and behaves as a king should. <br><br>Strong and decisive, Dagult acts always for the good of his subjects and realm\u2014and in doing so, has consistently built up his own power and wealth. Unfortunately for him, the Masked Lords of Waterdeep have recently chosen to replace him as Open Lord. Laeral Silverhand, his successor, claims her title in the second council meeting.<br><br>Dagult demands order and rewards discipline, but he is pragmatic and driven by results above all else. He knows that nothing comes without effort, and sacrifices must be made when necessary. Tireless in his actions, he never stops until he has achieved his goals. He will use any means at his disposal, as long as those means are legally justifiable\u2014even when such justification must be \u201crediscovered\u201d from long-forgotten or ignored laws.<br><br>In the first council meeting, Lord Dagult\u2019s resources have been spread thin between the massive investments he\u2019s made in rebuilding Neverwinter and in maintaining dominance in Waterdeep. He strongly supports the members of the Lords\u2019 Alliance pooling resources, because he worries that neither of his investments can survive the coming catastrophe without assistance. This changes by the second council. Though losing Waterdeep allows him to consolidate his strength, Dagult resents Laeral for taking his position. He avoids letting his feelings cloud his judgment, however, intent on showing that he is a more fitting leader by backing the adventurers and taking a firm leadership role in the council.<br><br><h3>Ambassador Connerad Brawnanvil</h3><em>Lawful good male shield dwarf fighter</em><br><strong>Ideals:</strong> Honor, respect (\u201cA sturdy axe, a strong hand to hold it, and a straight fight are all we dwarves need to end this little problem.\u201d)<br><strong>Personality Traits:</strong> Hot tempered, suspicious<br><strong>Pledged Resources:</strong> Dwarf soldiers and dwarf-forged armaments and siege weapons<br><br>Son of Banak Brawnanvil and a former king of Mithral Hall, Connerad has made the long journey from Mithral Hall to act as the Lords\u2019 Alliance delegate for the dwarves of the North, including Citadel Adbar and Citadel Felbarr.<br><br>Even though Connerad hates dragons, devils, and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cultists</a> alike, he is as stubborn as a mule about committing troops anywhere but his homeland. The dwarven kingdoms in the North have lost many people in recent years, and the dwarves that remain are struggling to retain ancient lands only recently reclaimed. He knows the adventurers only by reputation, and desires tangible proof that they have the mettle and wits to lead soldiers and dwarves before he\u2019ll make a serious commitment. Like <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzOTBlMDQ3OTRj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Ontharr Frume</a> of the Order of the Gauntlet, Connerad responds well to bold demonstrations of heroism. However, he is personally and deeply insulted by any slight against dwarves or intrusions by the characters into dwarven affairs. His reactions to the adventurers\u2019 exploits determine how he votes in the fourth council.<br><br><h3>Marshall Ulder Ravengard </h3><em>Lawful neutral male human fighter</em><br><strong>Ideals:</strong> Responsibility, glory (\u201cI am trusted with protecting thousands of lives, and I will not betray that trust no matter what my personal desires.\u201d)<br><strong>Interaction Traits:</strong> Honest<br><strong>Pledged Resources:</strong> Flaming Fist warriors and expert advisers to train conscript troops<br><br>Ulder Ravengard is the leader of the Flaming Fist\u2014the military might of Baldur\u2019s Gate. He has the greatest martial acumen of anyone at the council (and probably in the whole Lords\u2019 Alliance). He can also muster more soldiers than any other delegate, and he is not bashful about saying so. His place is at the head of the war council and the front of the battle\u2014but he will take that place only if the party proves worthy of his trust.<br><br>Ravengard is a stern warrior dedicated to discipline and results. Having risen through the ranks of the Flaming Fist by the might of his blade and the sharpness of his wits, he sometimes lacks sophistication and tact, but he possesses an unwavering commitment to the law. More comfortable working with soldiers than adventurers, Ravengard is used to giving orders and having them obeyed without question.<br><br>Though Baldur\u2019s Gate is still recovering from the havoc caused by the resurrection within the city of Bhaal, god of murder, the metropolis remains one of Faer\u00fbn\u2019s most populous, wealthy, and powerful cities. Ravengard recognizes his duty to protect the city above all else, and the Flaming Fist\u2019s tired reserves are desperately needed for reconstruction and policing. However, he would love to see the Flaming Fist take a leading role in the fight against the Cult of the Dragon, if only to give the defenders of Baldur\u2019s Gate a stature befitting the greatest city in Faer\u00fbn. This opportunity for glory makes Ravengard receptive to the adventurers\u2019 overtures, as long as their plans and decisions promise stability and discipline.<br><br><h3>King Melandrach</h3><em>Neutral male wild elf fighter/druid</em><br><strong>Ideals:</strong> Balance, nation (\u201cWe elves were once the greatest civilization to grace Faer\u00fbn, and my people are heir to that history. I will not squander our waning strength.\u201d)<br><strong>Interaction Traits:</strong> Quiet, arrogant<br><strong>Pledged Resources:</strong> Elven eldritch <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDA3Yzg1ODJiZGY3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>knights</a><br><br>The King of the Misty Forest is the delegate for the elves of both the Misty Forest and the High Forest. Whereas his sons Alagarthas and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTY5YjAwZmZlZTI5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Neronvain</a> always rushed headlong into their own pursuits, Melandrach is more circumspect. He has led the elves of the Misty Forest since before most of their kind abandoned their lands in the Retreat. Despite the years of discussion and meditation that preceded it, Melandrach considered the Retreat a rash decision, and he is understandably hesitant to commit to any sudden course of action.<br><br>During meetings of the council, Melandrach consistently argues for caution and more information, and nothing the adventurers say seems to make any difference. That changes when it is revealed that his lost son <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTY5YjAwZmZlZTI5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Neronvain</a> has become the cult\u2019s Green Wyrmspeaker. <br><br><h3>Taern \u201cThunderspells\u201d Hornblade</h3><em>Lawful good male human wizard</em><br><strong>Ideals:</strong> Logic, greater good (\u201cCalculated risks are necessary to win this war, and no one is likely to emerge unscathed.\u201d) <br><strong>Interaction Traits:</strong> Ponderous, curious<br><strong>Pledged Resources:</strong> The army of Silverymoon (the Knights in Silver) and Silverymoon conscript troops<br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWVkNzhhMjU3ODZm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Taern Hornblade</a> has lived an unnaturally long life by consuming <em>potions of longevity</em>. The wizard led Silverymoon for many years as high mage, but eventually ceded control to Methrammar, leader of the city\u2019s army and son of its most famous ruler, Alustriel. Though Methrammar remains leader of Silverymoon and a member of the Lords\u2019 Alliance, he is too forthright and earnest to succeed as a diplomat. As such, Taern was sent to the Council of Waterdeep in his stead. <br><br>Silverymoon has a large army and many wizards who would greatly assist in the coming battle, but Taern has not lived this long by being rash. He is one of the most cautious delegates, knowing that Silverymoon\u2019s great wards of protection have stood against dragons before. Fearing that committing soldiers to the effort against the Cult of the Dragon might leave the city weakened, Taern needs to know that the party will protect any troops he lends to the coalition. As such, he seeks to gather as much information as possible about the adventurers and other potential allies.<br><br><h3>Sir Isteval </h3><em>Lawful good male human paladin</em><br><strong>Ideals:</strong> Tradition, honor (\u201cAgainst Tiamat, we either stand together or fall alone. Who will stand with Cormyr?\u201d) <br><strong>Interaction Traits:</strong> Honorable, wise, dour<br><strong>Pledged Resources:</strong> The might of Cormyr, including Purple Dragon Knights and War Wizards<br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Mzc1OGY3OWZlOWEx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Sir </a><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Mzc1OGY3OWZlOWEx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Isteval</a> is a former adventurer and Purple Dragon Knight of Cormyr. Though not an actual member of the Lords\u2019 Alliance, he is present at the Council of Waterdeep as the alliance\u2019s nominal representative for Daggerford. That small settlement can contribute little to the effort to defeat the Cult of the Dragon, however, and in truth, Isteval has been drafted by Cormyr to gain insight into what looks to be a war brewing on its western border.<br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Mzc1OGY3OWZlOWEx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Isteval</a> has too much respect for the other delegates to hide this information from them, and he assures those present that his loyalties\u2014to Daggerford, to Cormyr, to the Lords\u2019 Alliance, and to all good folk\u2014are not at cross-purposes. This forthright approach nevertheless causes an uproar among other delegates, and the adventurers must take a hand in insuring that Isteval is not expelled from the council meetings.<br><br>A veteran dragon slayer, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Mzc1OGY3OWZlOWEx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Isteval</a> bears a wound in his leg that resists magical healing, and he walks with a cane made from a bone of the green dragon that dealt him the injury. The paladin can be a helpful source of dragon lore, but his advice is always guarded. He sees his infirmity as a reminder from his god Lathander of the dangers of hubris. As befits his deity\u2019s ethos, Isteval has chosen to treat his injury as a reason to encourage the heroics of others even as his own legend fades. Still, at times like these when the world needs heroes, he doesn\u2019t like being reminded that he must watch the fight from the sidelines.<br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Mzc1OGY3OWZlOWEx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Isteval</a> believes in heroes as the spark that can ignite the flames of righteousness in others and the light that chases away the darkness of evil. Seeing this spark in the adventurers makes the paladin one of the party\u2019s strongest advocates at the Council of Waterdeep, as long as they pursue a principled path. <br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Mzc1OGY3OWZlOWEx ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Sir Isteval</a> has much in common with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzOTBlMDQ3OTRj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Ontharr Frume</a> of the Order of the Gauntlet.

If you played <em>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</em>, the characters might have already made their way back to the City of Splendors after Skyreach Castle crashed at the end of that first adventure. If you didn\u2019t play<em> Hoard of the Dragon Queen</em>, if Skyreach Castle wasn\u2019t crashed, or if the characters went somewhere other than Waterdeep afterward, you need to get the party back to Waterdeep for the start of this adventure.<br><br>It\u2019s easy enough to simply tell the players that their characters are back in Waterdeep. However, if you suspect that your group won\u2019t find that satisfying, you can avoid playing through a long overland journey by making use of the following scenario. <br><br>Wherever the characters are when this session begins, a raven flies up to them. The bird is part of an <em>animal messenger</em> relay dispatched by Leosin Erlanthar\u2019s allies in the Emerald Enclave.<br><br><blockquote>The raven lands a dozen paces from you, then boldly hops closer, a flat parcel wrapped in oilskin strapped to its belly. It eyes you enigmatically for a few moments, then speaks in a familiar voice. \u201cLeosin Erlanthar sends his heartiest congratulations! Please use the gift this bird brings to meet me in Waterdeep as soon as possible.\u201d</blockquote><br>The bird waits patiently while the leather parcel is removed from its harness. The parcel contains a carefully folded <em>teleport </em>scroll and the sigil sequence of a permanent teleport circle in Waterdeep. The circle can be in a temple, a government building, or any other site of your choice. If the party includes more than six characters, the parcel contains two scrolls. If none of the characters can use a <em>teleport </em>scroll, they\u2019ll need to seek out an NPC who can. Just don\u2019t make it too difficult.<hr><h3>Back in Waterdeep</h3>The most powerful factions of the Sword Coast all recognize the significance of Tiamat\u2019s possible return, and they are willing to cooperate with each other to prevent it. Trust doesn\u2019t come easily for these disparate groups. But even for orders and organizations that have been in conflict in the past, the \u201cenemy of my enemy\u201d is easily understood. <br><br>To coordinate their efforts against the Cult of the Dragon, the factions have sent important delegates for secret meetings in Waterdeep. If the adventurers played through<em> Hoard of the Dragon Queen</em>, they now know as much as anyone about the cult\u2019s activities, and their heroics have been brought to the attention of powerful leaders and earned them a place at the council table. If you didn\u2019t play <em>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</em>, a separate group of heroes assaulted Skyreach Castle and bravely gave their lives to crash the fortress. The characters are then invited to the council simply because of their reputation as powerful adventurers, and because the council expects to need their services.<hr><h3>Four Councils</h3>When the characters arrive in Waterdeep, they are met by the Harper agent <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDY2ZmM5YjA3MmQ0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Leosin Erlanthar</a>. The monk explains the purpose of the council and tells the adventurers they are expected to attend the first gathering\u2014both so the council can thank them for their great deeds and to advise the council about the Cult of the Dragon. Four meetings of the council occur at critical points throughout the crisis, right up to the final episode of the adventure at the Well of Dragons.<br><br>During the <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDIwNjUzOWQ4ZmFh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>first session</a></strong> of the council, all the Sword Coast becomes aware of how the Cult of the Dragon\u2019s plots are advancing when the <em>Draakhorn </em>sounds. In the aftermath, the characters are given leads to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjdkMmNjYTkyZmQz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>episode 2</a> or to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGQ5NjU0MjAwZjli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Varram</a> in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YTE2ZTdmYTlkMmIz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>episode 3</a>.<br><br>A <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZjY5NjlhZTI1NmNh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>second session</a></strong><strong> </strong>of the council is summoned to address increasingly aggressive dragon activity.

The adventurers are also approached by a representative who wishes to bring the party to a secret meeting with the metallic dragons, leading to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YmU3MGIxNDRlMjM2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>episode 6</a>. <br><br>A<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWNhNDA4MGE0Zjk0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>third session</a> </strong>of the council is called to assess the gains made by the allied factions against <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTRhOTg1ODUwZWM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>the Cult of the Dragon</a>. The party is called on to pursue two leads that might grant even more advantage over the cult\u2014a renegade cultist offering to turn over one of the dragon masks, in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTUzZTA1NTAxNjMy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>episode 7</a>, and an attempt to undercut the power of the exile Red Wizards in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OTcwN2MyOWZmMzJh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>episode 8</a>.<br><br>At the<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OTNlYzRlYzc3MmI2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>fourth session</a></strong> of the Council of Waterdeep, the adventurers learn that the plots of the Cult of the Dragon and the Red Wizards are nearing fruition. The forces of the various factions must gather in preparation for the assault on the Well of Dragons.<br><br>During each new council, the various factions measure the party\u2019s actions and achievements, comparing those actions to their own goals. Characters who further the goals of a faction will find that faction willing to pledge more resources to the fight against the cult. However, gaining the allegiance of one faction might lead to distrust from others. The adventurers must strike a careful balance in their appeal to\u2014and appeasement of\u2014the delegates to gather the strongest force possible to confront Tiamat.<br><br>Though it isn\u2019t ideal for all attendees, the Lords\u2019 Palace in Waterdeep is the designated location of the council meetings. The Lords\u2019 Alliance faction is sending the most delegates, and those delegates prefer a civilized gathering place. <hr><h3>Gathering Allies</h3>Though every faction provides some troops and resources toward the final showdown with the forces of Tiamat, the extent of their support\u2014and how much effect that support will have\u2014is dependent on the respect the adventurers garner from each group for their actions. Before committing irrevocably to the fight, a faction must be convinced that the cult presents a danger surpassing all other concerns\u2014and that the adventurers are the right heroes to lead this fight. Moreover, what is worthy of respect in one faction might lose respect from another. <br><br>As the adventurers successfully complete episodes of the adventure, you track how they earn or lose respect from each faction on the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2Q2YzQ3YjAyMjcz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Council Scorecard</a> (appendix C).

In general, only the leaders of each delegation are present at the council meetings attended by the adventurers. However, no matter how individual delegates might react to the characters\u2019 deeds, they also heed the words of their fellow councilors not present at the council meetings. Brave and heroic feats that individual leaders might approve of could be frowned on by a faction as a whole if those deeds don\u2019t line up with the faction\u2019s agenda.<br><br></section>", "img": ""}

In all cases, see those specific episodes for full details.<br><br>Two preliminary events help to set up the first session of the council: news of the assassination of Arthagast Ulbrinter, one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep, and the sounding of the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjM1NWY5NDNhOTlk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Draakhorn</a></em>.<hr><h3>Death of a Masked Lord</h3>Though the leadership of the Cult of the Dragon could not have realized it, one of the key events in the fight to thwart Severin\u2019s plans was the cult\u2019s assassination of Arthagast Ulbrinter, a Masked Lord of Waterdeep and husband of Remi Haventree of the Harpers. News of Arthagast\u2019s recent murder has spread across the Sword Coast, and has galvanized opposition to the cult in Waterdeep.<br><br>In her grief, Remi Haventree has sworn to destroy the cult and the threat it presents to the Sword Coast. She has been instrumental in bringing the factions together for this Council of Waterdeep, setting up the potential for alliances that the adventurers must now complete.<hr><h3>The Draakhorn Sounds</h3>Shortly after the crash or capture of Skyreach Castle, operatives of the Cult of the Dragon sounded the <em>Draakhorn </em>at the distant Well of Dragons. An ancient magic relic, the <em>Draakhorn </em>is being used by the cult to summon chromatic dragons to their dark cause.<br><br>As the characters are arriving in Waterdeep, read or paraphrase the following.<br><br><blockquote>A sudden shift in the wind brings with it a strange sense of unease. The feeling is akin to the drop in air pressure before the approach of a deadly storm, or faint tremors felt from a landslide or earthquake far away. You\u2019re not the only ones who have noticed. The city around you goes unnaturally quiet suddenly. No dogs bark, no birds squawk. Even the street vendors have gone silent. </blockquote><br>The silence lasts only a moment before the normal sounds of Waterdeep return to mask the unexplained sensation. If the characters get to a quiet place, they notice the disturbance again, like a rumbling almost too faint to hear. As well, subtle changes in the behavior of animals can be noted. Dogs are nervous and on edge, horses are skittish, cats are more feral than usual, and rats gather in large, bold packs. Sensitive NPCs are also affected, becoming nervous, fearful, and impatient. <br><br>During the first session of the council (or earlier if the characters make efforts to investigate the strange phenomenon), the adventurers are approached by Dala Silmerhelve\u2014a Waterdhavian noble. Read or paraphrase the following when the characters speak to Dala.<br><br><blockquote>\u201cThe disturbance that\u2019s been sensed across the Sword Coast is the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjM1NWY5NDNhOTlk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Draakhorn</a></em>\u2014an ancient device whose sounding alerts dragons across Faer\u00fbn that great events are unfolding. It\u2019s impossible to say what the sounding means, but the dragons hear it clearly and will eventually answer its call. \u201d</blockquote><br>Lady Silmerhelve learned this from her family\u2019s secret benefactor, an ancient bronze dragon named <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzBhZmZlMDA1ZGUw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Nymmurh</a>. She knows a little more about the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjM1NWY5NDNhOTlk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Draakhorn</a></em>, but she waits to reveal it until she attends the first council meeting. She flatly refuses to tell anyone the source of her knowledge if asked. This makes Ulder Ravengard, King Conneerad, and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzOTBlMDQ3OTRj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Ontharr Frume</a> suspicious, but others take the secrecy in stride. If Lady Silmerhelve is treated poorly, it might affect how Nymmurh interacts with the characters in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YmU3MGIxNDRlMjM2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Episode 6</a><br>", "img": ""}

Make the introduction to the City of Splendors and the Lords\u2019 Palace as detailed or as simple as fits your campaign style.<br><br>Once inside the Lords\u2019 Palace, the party is escorted to the secret council chambers by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDY2ZmM5YjA3MmQ0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Leosin Erlanthar</a>. The outer galleries are packed with nobles engaged in heated debate, and the guards are wearing livery from city-states across the North. <br><br>Although Erlanthar is not invited to the council discussions, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZWM0NzhkZDM3YTkw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Remallia Haventree</a> has informed him of the agenda and the reason the party has been summoned. He advises the characters that though the factions are all nominally committed to stopping the Cult of the Dragon, none of the delegates have made substantive pledges yet. <br><br>Too much mistrust still burdens the factions, and not enough is known about the situation. Erlanthar thinks the leaders need someone to show them the right path\u2014heroes who will lead the forces of the Sword Coast with certainty into the coming darkness. He believes that the adventurers have a chance to be those heroes. However, he explains that each faction will weigh every word the characters say and scrutinize every one of their decisions. What pleases one group might anger another, and it will be incredibly difficult to make all parties happy.<hr><h3>Follow-up: Hoard of the Dragon Queen</h3>Once introductions are made, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZmI5YjVhY2QyNTI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Dagult Neverember</a> summarizes the situation if the adventurers did not play through <em>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</em>. This includes the plan to summon Tiamat, increased dragon raids led by the cult, the treasure collection system, the crash or capture of Skyreach Castle, and the importance of the wyrmspeakers and dragon masks to the cult.<br><br>If the party played through the previous adventure, Dagult explains that the council has heard reports from Ontharr, Leosin, and other witnesses, but that the delegates wish to hear from the heroes at the center of recent events. (At this point, use Neverember to also fill in any information the characters did not gather during <em>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</em> that you deem important.)<br><br>Most of the factions recognize that Skyreach Castle needed to be stopped, and they are happy if the castle was crashed. However, some members of the Lords\u2019 Alliance think it unconscionable that such a resource would be destroyed, intentionally or otherwise. These dissidents believe it would have been better for the characters to have waited for reinforcements, then attacked to secure the castle (regardless of how unrealistic that plan might have been).<br><br>The fate of the dragon hatchery divides opinion as well. Most delegates respect a decision to destroy the hatchery, accepting that having fewer dragons to deal with later on is an advantage. However, the Harpers would have preferred the eggs to be kept for ransoming back to their parents, potentially keeping those dragons from cooperating with the cult. Dagult would have sold the valuable eggs to \u201cresponsible buyers,\u201d then used that gold to hire more mercenaries. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDdhYjQ2NTZlZDBi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Emerald Enclave</a> is firmly against any dragon eggs being destroyed, believing that the chromatic dragons are a part of the natural order and that killing their young upsets the balance of that order. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OWVkNzhhMjU3ODZm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Taern Hornblade</a> and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MGZkOGJlZGFmMjhl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Lady Laeral Silverhand</a> think there might have been a way to leverage the eggs as ransom, but both recognize that they would have been dangerous to hold onto\u2014and even more dangerous to return.<br><br>When the discussion around the events from <em>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</em> is concluded, the council moves on to current matters. It\u2019s obvious to all that the adventurers have taken a firm hand in addressing this crisis, and that they have proven their worth. The council deputizes the characters with emergency investigative powers and a writ demonstrating such.

Though most are pleased with capturing Varram, the Emerald Enclave is nonplussed, believing that capturing him only complicates matters. Varram has already demonstrated a willingness to corrupt the natural order, making a trial excessive\u2014and potentially opening the door to a rescue attempt.<hr><h3>Follow-up: The Sea of Moving Ice</h3>The Arcane Brotherhood are powerful allies, and all are pleased if the party wins their allegiance\u2014with the exception of the Order of the Gauntlet. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzAzOTBlMDQ3OTRj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Ontharr Frume</a> knows that the Arcane Brotherhood does not police its members in what kinds of knowledge they pursue, and that they tolerate many evil wizards in their company.

In such a scenario, a dragon protects a 100-mile-radius area around the point where it is assigned, stopping draconic raids in that area.<hr><h3>Setup: Xonthal\u2019s Tower</h3>At the summit, information comes to the characters revealing that a senior member of the Cult of the Dragon seeks to defect from the group, and that the cultist is offering a dragon mask as part of his plea for aid. Though the offer could be a trap, the council delegates believe that the risk is worth it. The defector is holed up in a fortress known as <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2IzMmZhZDlmYjgz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Xonthal\u2019s Tower</a>, recently taken over by the cult.

Successfully completing an episode of the adventure will usually gain support from multiple factions. However, each faction has its own priorities, and sometimes a heroic deed that pleases one faction can anger or disappoint another. In some cases, a faction might even prefer that the characters engage in antiheroic acts\u2014by executing certain enemies rather than taking prisoners, for example. The adventurers might also be seen to be favoring certain factions, if metallic dragon allies are sent to defend the interests and settlements of one faction over another.<br><br>Each faction has its own column on the scorecard. Important events that occur during<em> The Rise of Tiamat </em>are noted along the side of the scorecard, beginning with events that could have occurred in the previous adventure, <em>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</em>.

Gigantic icebergs wander listlessly through this glasslike sea, or are sent smashing and grinding against each other by bitterly cold winds, the sea spray transformed into fantastic frozen shapes around them. Only creatures adapted to severe cold can survive such frigid extremes, but many beasts\u2014and even people\u2014make their homes in the Sea of Moving Ice. One such creature is the white dragon Arauthator, known as \u201cOld White Death\u201d by those he stalks and terrorizes. In this section of the adventure, the heroes\u2019 battle against the cult leads them to one of Arauthator\u2019s iceberg lairs. <br><hr><h3>The Draakhorn\u2019s Call</h3>Each time the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjM1NWY5NDNhOTlk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Draakhorn</a></em> sounds out, its unearthly call echoes across the Sword Coast. Dragons hear it plainly, even as other creatures hear it only as an indistinct moaning when their surroundings are quiet and the wind blows just right. Creatures that cannot hear the <em>Draakhorn</em> can still sense it, like a faint vibration felt subconsciously and interpreted as a sense of dread. <br><br>The adventurers were introduced to the <em>Draakhorn</em> by Dala Silmerhelve during the first session of the Council of Waterdeep (See <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OTVlODE2MjljODU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Setting up the Sessions</a>). When they are ready to seek more information on the ancient relic, Dala provides it.<br><br><blockquote>\u201cThe Sea of Moving Ice was the last known location of the Draakhorn. No one can pinpoint its present location from the sound, or even verify with certainty that the relic is still in the northern sea, but the search must start there.<br><br>\u201cThe one person who could tell us more is a tiefling sorcerer called Maccath the Crimson. No one alive knows more about the Draakhorn than her, but the Arcane Brotherhood, of which she is also a member, hasn\u2019t seen her for three years. She was investigating the Sea of Moving Ice when she disappeared.\u201d</blockquote><hr><h3>\u201cOld White Death\u201d</h3>The white dragon Arauthator haunts the Sea of Moving Ice like an avenging wind. Personifying the brutality and savagery of his kind, Arauthator is a solid ally of the Cult of the Dragon, and can be counted on to be present at the Well of Dragons when Tiamat makes her triumphant return from the Nine Hells. <br><br>Arauthator\u2019s chief lair is beneath a remote peak known as Lonefang Mountain, but he maintains a number of smaller lairs among the icebergs that drift with the seasonal tides in the Sea of Moving Ice. One of these is known as <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a> (\u201cisland of eternity\u201d) by the local tribes known as the Ice Hunters, because of the many enemies Arauthator has frozen into the icy walls of the berg\u2019s hollowed interior.<br><br>In addition to his size, cunning, and ferocity, Arauthator wields spellcasting power that makes him a particularly dangerous foe. More than a century ago, during one of the cyclical periods of draconic violence known as the Rage of Dragons, Arauthator joined with a dozen other dragons in attacking the Hosttower of the Arcane in Luskan. Their assault toppled the west arm of the tower, and Arauthator was seen scooping up numerous items of great magical importance and power, including at least three tomes of rare spells. The possibility of recovering those books is part of what drew <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGU2NWMzM2Q5OGJi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Maccath the Crimson</a> to the Sea of Moving Ice.<br><br>Arauthator\u2019s iceberg lair serves primarily as a meeting ground for him and his mate, the ancient white dragon Arveiaturace (\u201cthe White Wyrm\u201d). She is aware of the cult\u2019s activity but has been reluctant to join forces with it, and Arauthator seeks a way to gain her commitment. At one time, Arveiaturace served a wizard named Meltharond, whose corpse remains strapped to a saddle on the dragon\u2019s back. She has never accepted his death, and still speaks to him as if he were alive. Arauthator hopes that if he provides Arveiaturace with a new wizard to serve, she will recover from her grief and join him in wholeheartedly supporting the Cult of the Dragon. When the proud, ambitious Maccath the Crimson arrived in Arauthator\u2019s lair, the dragon enticed her with the prospect of becoming Arveiaturace\u2019s master and rider. <br><hr><h3>Maccath the Crimson</h3>The Arcane Brotherhood is a league of mages based in the city of Luskan at the fabled Hosttower of the Arcane. The Hosttower is an academy for the best and brightest mages of Faer\u00fbn. Only the most promising are accepted as members in the Arcane Brotherhood, and only members of the order can study at the Hosttower. <br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGU2NWMzM2Q5OGJi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Maccath the Crimson</a> was one of those best and brightest when she journeyed to the Hosttower seeking admission. Her knowledge of dragon lore and draconic relics was already vast, but she wanted to know more about the dragons\u2019 magic. Even though she gained access to the accumulated lore of the Arcane Brotherhood, Maccath concluded that some questions could be answered only by dragons\u2014and that questions about the magic stolen from the Hosttower during the last Rage of Dragons could be answered only by Arauthator. Maccath set sail on an expedition to learn those answers three years ago and hasn\u2019t been heard from since. <br><br>Dala Silmerhelve provides the characters with all that is known of Maccath\u2019s fate.<br><br><blockquote>\u201cMaccath reported her progress to the Hosttower by way of sending spells. Her last report spoke of seeing Ice Hunters paddling their sealskin boats toward a huge iceberg, flattened like a plateau across its surface, but ringed by icy peaks. She had intended to follow the Ice Hunters and investigate the iceberg. After that, no more reports came.<br><br>\u201cAttempts to find Maccath using scrying and other magical means located only her ship, adrift and heavily damaged. Some of the ship\u2019s crew were seen dead, but no sign of the tiefling sorcerer was ever found. However, the lair of a dragon as powerful as Arauthator is no doubt protected against scrying magic. If Maccath is alive, in addition to the lore she can share regarding the Draakhorn, the Arcane Brotherhood would be most grateful to get her back.\u201d</blockquote><hr id=\"userscript-horizontalrule\"><h3>Setting Sail</h3>In Waterdeep, the characters are outfitted with cold weather gear, including snowshoes suitable for traversing deep drifts, and have passage north arranged on a ship specially built for plying the waters of the Sea of Moving Ice. <em>Frostskimmr</em> is captained by a human male known as Lerustah Half-face. The right half of his face was left a scarred ruin from severe frostbite suffered years ago on the Sea of Moving Ice. He keeps a leather hood drawn across his face most of the time, both for warmth and so as not to frighten children. Lerustah is a brave explorer and a skilled sailor.<br><br><em>Frostskimmr</em> is a light longship with a shallow draft, driven by a single sail or by oars when necessary. The combination of wind and oar power is needed for picking a course through close-packed ice. Despite the ship\u2019s length of nearly sixty feet, it is still light enough to be lifted by its forty crew members if it becomes hemmed in by ice. The ship is open to the air, but the crew rig sailcloth shelters across the deck to keep away the wind and sleet and hold in some warmth. <br><br><strong><em>Roll20 Note:</em></strong> We have included the sample ship layout from the Dungeon Master's Guide for use if desired, scaled to 80 feet in length. <br></section>", "img": "modules/mod-rise-of-tiamat/journal/002_-_Episode_2_3A_The_Sea_of_Moving_Ice/000_-_Introduction_to_Episode_2/avatar.png"}

With favorable winds, <em>Frostskimmr</em> reaches the Sea of Moving Ice in a few days. From that point, the ship must slow down and proceed cautiously.<br><br>Captain Lerustah has no strong feelings one way or the other about whether the crew should pull <em>Frostskimmr</em> onto an ice floe at night or spend the night on the water. An ice floe is more comfortable and offers safety from certain aquatic creatures. On the open water, the ship is safer from creatures that hunt only on the ice, but sleeping on the deck is colder and less comfortable than in an easily built snow shelter. The decision of where to spend the night is up to the characters. <br><hr><h3>Ice Hunters</h3>The Ice Hunters are nomads that have lived in the North far longer than any other humans. Short, dark-haired, broad-faced, and with light brown skin, they cling stolidly to their culture and their traditions of fishing and whaling on the Sea of Moving Ice, and of hunting for seal, walrus, and polar bears among the ice floes. They travel by dogsled on land and ice, and paddle seal-hide boats called khyeks or oumyeks across the frigid water. They worship totems of animals from the world around them, such as Clever Oomio the gray seal, Grandfather Walrus, Great White Bear, and Pindalpau-pau the Reindeer Mother.<br><br>The Ice Hunters came unaware to the dragon\u2019s iceberg generations ago. Desiring servants to guard his lair during his long absences, the dragon killed just enough of the tribesfolk to force the rest to obey him out of terror. Using their unsurpassed ability as scouts, they act now as Arauthator\u2019s eyes and ears on the Sea of Moving Ice. Living as thralls, they have no doubt that if they ever leave the iceberg, Arauthator will hunt them down and take horrific revenge. <br><hr><h3>Random Encounters</h3>Searching the Sea of Moving Ice for the plateau-like iceberg described by Maccath is a time-consuming process. Roll a d6 each morning, afternoon, and night. On a roll of 1, an encounter occurs. Roll on the table to determine the specifics, adding +1 for each previous table roll made while the characters were searching from the ship on water by day. Searching by night or searching by day while Frostskimmr is on an ice floe doesn\u2019t improve the odds of finding <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a>.<br><br><h4>Sea of Moving Ice Encounters</h4><table><thead><tr><td>d6</td><td>Encounter of Event</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Giant octopi</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Merrow</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Polar bear</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Scrags</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Ice Hunters</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Ice Hunters in fishing boats</td></tr><tr><td>7+</td><td>Oyaviggaton sighted</td></tr></tbody></table><br><strong><em>Roll20 Note:</em></strong> We have provided a rollable table for these encounters, however the DM will have to manually add in a +1 to the result themselves as a rollable table does not currently have the ability to account for cumulative additions to results.<br><br>If combat becomes necessary, Captain Lerustah fights as a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDA3Yzg1ODJiZGY3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>knight</a></strong> and his crew fight as 40 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzIyOTU3OTAzY2Vl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guards</a></strong>. If fighting aboard <em>Frostskimmr</em>, the characters must be cautious while using area spells that deal fire or force damage. One such spell does minimal damage that can be fixed by the crew at sea after the fight ends. If two such spells are used, <em>Frostskimmr</em> must be hauled onto an ice floe for repairs that take half a day. Roll normally for events during that time, but reroll any total of 7 or higher.<br><br><strong><em>Giant Octopi.</em></strong> This event can occur by day or night, but only on water. Two <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTk4MGZkYzRmNTM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>giant octopi</a></strong> attack simultaneously, trying to drag characters and crew off the ship into the freezing water. When one octopus is killed, the other withdraws underwater and escapes. <br><br><strong><em>Merrow.</em></strong> This event can occur by day or night, on ice or water. Five <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWQ0ZjcyZGUwZWJi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>merrow</a></strong> move as close as possible to <em>Frostskimmr</em> before attacking. If the characters are on the ship, the merrow try to swamp it by making a DC 25 Strength check, with a +2 bonus to the check for each additional merrow involved in the attempt. Success means that <em>Frostskimmr</em> lurches dangerously and each creature on board must make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature is dumped overboard. (To make things easy, divide the crew into groups of five and make one saving throw for each group.)<br><br>A creature that falls into the frigid water is swimming, and must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw at the start of each turn that it is in the water. On each failed saving throw, the creature suffers one level of exhaustion. Characters in the water are preferred targets for monsters in the water.<br><br><strong><em>Polar Bear.</em></strong> This event can occur day or night, but only on the ice. A crew member aboard <em>Frostskimmr</em> spots a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTU0ZDdjOTg3ZGIw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>polar bear</a></strong> stalking a wounded Ice Hunter on an ice floe. If the characters intervene and save the hunter, he is grateful, and converses with them in his own tongue. (If the characters have no means to communicate with him, one of <em>Frostskimmr</em>\u2019s crew can translate.) Though he is not from the tribe that lives on <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a>, the hunter knows the iceberg. In response to any questions about Oyaviggaton, he advises the characters as to its distance and direction from their current position, but warns them to keep away from it. Armed with this information, the characters gain a +1 bonus to their next two daytime event rolls.<br><br><strong><em>Scrags.</em></strong> This event occurs only at night, and only on the ice. While <em>Frostskimmr</em> sits on an ice floe to wait for morning, three aquatic trolls, known as <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NDBmNjAyYjEyNmM2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>scrags</a></strong> (swim speed 30 ft., can breathe underwater), attack the ship. If the characters and crew don\u2019t intend to haul <em>Frostskimmr</em> onto an ice floe for the night, one of the scrags swims beneath the ship and wrenches a plank loose, causing a serious leak that requires the ship to be pulled onto the ice for repairs. <br><br><strong><em>Ice Hunters.</em></strong> This event can occur only by day. A hunting party from <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a> (12 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2IwOWM2ZDQyY2Vi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>tribal warriors</a></strong>) is spotted pursuing seals on an ice floe, whether <em>Frostskimmr</em> is on the water or on an adjacent ice floe. The hunters are surly and uncommunicative if approached, knowing that they must return to the iceberg before nightfall or their kin will be punished. Captain Lerustah is puzzled by their behavior, knowing that the Ice Hunter people are shy but never hostile. The hunters quickly paddle their khyeks away to the northeast. If the characters follow the hunters or use that bearing for the next stage of their journey, they gain a +1 bonus to their next daytime event roll. <br><br><strong><em>Ice Hunters in Fishing Boats.</em></strong> This event occurs only during the day. A group of fishers from <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a> (12 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2IwOWM2ZDQyY2Vi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>tribal warriors</a></strong>) are spotted in their characteristic boats, whether <em>Frostskimmr</em> is in the water or on a nearby ice floe. They are unfriendly and uncommunicative if approached, paddling away to the northeast as soon as they are able. If the characters follow the hunters or use that bearing for the next stage of their journey, they gain a +1 bonus to their next daytime event roll.<br><br><strong><em>Oyaviggaton Sighted.</em></strong> This event can occur by day or night. There\u2019s no mistaking the silhouette of this massive iceberg as matching the description given by <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGU2NWMzM2Q5OGJi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Maccath the Crimson</a>. With a flattened expanse at one end rising to jagged peaks at the other, the characters\u2019 objective is at hand.<br></section>", "img": ""}
{"_id": "ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz", "name": "Oyaviggaton", "permission": {"default": 0}, "folder": null, "flags": {"R20Converter": {"handout-order": 2, "handout-archived": false}}, "sort": 20000, "entryTime": 0, "content": "\n<section class=\"secret\"><p>GM Notes : </p><h2>Oyaviggaton</h2>Arauthator\u2019s iceberg lair rises from the sea to form a floating island. The portion of the berg above the water appears roughly triangular, with rounded corners. The plateau portion of the iceberg rises more than a hundred feet above the water, and the jagged ice peaks add another two hundred feet above that.<br><br>The Ice Hunter village is a collection of snow shelters and tents sitting at the center of the island. The village can\u2019t be seen from the sea because of the berg\u2019s height, but a large shelf of ice where the Ice Hunters beach their boats is clearly visible from the water. Approximately 60 feet across, the shelf rises a few feet above sea level and is littered with enormous, cracked bones\u2014including ribs that arch taller than a human. <br><br>A character proficient in Nature recognizes that the bones are mostly from whales and huge seals (or Captain Lerustah can supply that information). Any character who spends a few minutes examining the bones discovers tooth marks with a monstrous bite radius\u2014evidence that a gigantic predator (Arauthator) ate at least some of these creatures. Examining the bones reveals smaller human bones in the pile as well, all of which show the same bite marks. <br><br>An ice chasm splits the cliff face above the ice shelf, rising to the top of the plateau. The chasm is 20 feet wide near the bottom but narrows to 5 feet wide at the top. Steps are cut into the ice, making for an easy climb to the top of the plateau. <br><br>Captain Lerustah would like to keep his crew members aboard <em>Frostskimmr</em> rather than marching them up to the plateau. He\u2019s not at all comfortable with the idea of leaving his ship without the strongest possible complement of guards. If the characters are unable to communicate with the Ice Hunters (who speak only their own language, Uluik), one of the crew members speaks enough Uluik to get by. The translator will accompany the characters onto the iceberg if he\u2019s paid a bonus of at least 50 gp, but he returns to the ship as soon as the characters descend into the ice caves.<br><hr><h3>The Village</h3>The top of Oyaviggaton is a plateau, but it\u2019s not level. The ground is uneven, fractured by narrow ice chasms and divided by rills, snowdrifts, and ice ridges taller than a human, sculpted by sea spray and wind. The ridges block the view of the village until characters are 200 feet from the nearest shelter.<br><br>The first sight that greets the adventurers when they emerge onto the plateau is a row of ten corpses frozen into a wall of ice: three Luskar warriors, a dwarf, and six Ice Hunters. The bodies have been preserved in the ice, making it impossible to tell how long they\u2019ve been here. The southerners and the dwarf were some of Maccath the Crimson\u2019s companions, killed by Arauthator. The Ice Hunters used the bodies to put up this grisly warning, in the hope that other intruders might fear the same fate and turn back. The dead Ice Hunters tried to flee from the iceberg but were hunted and killed by Arauthator, who forced their kin to add them to the horrid display.<br><br><h4>Layout</h4>The village sits in a sheltered spot near the center of the iceberg. When the wind blows\u2014which is most of the time\u2014snow whips off the surrounding drifts and surrounds the settlement in a swirling shroud of white. <br><br>Twenty structures make up the village, divided between snow-block shelters similar to igloos and double-walled yurts made from sealskin stretched over whalebone frames. Sixteen of these structures are small, one-room family dwellings. One ice-block shelter is a storeroom used for gear owned in common by the tribesfolk, including fishing nets and heavy ropes used for whaling. One yurt near the center of the village is slightly larger than the others, and is home to the Ice Hunter chieftain, Barking Seal. A yurt standing apart from the rest of the shelters is home to the shaman Bonecarver, as indicated by the many animal totems and whalebone carvings around the hut. The shaman\u2019s hut features a lesser-used entrance to the ice caves.<br><br>The largest structure in the village is the meeting hall, heavily decorated with whalebone and the skulls of fish and mammals. Consisting of one large room, the hall has a wooden floor made of planks salvaged from ships caught and crushed in the Sea of Moving Ice. Beneath the planks in a back corner is an entrance to the ice caves under the village, which lead to Arauthator\u2019s grotto. A long coil of rope hangs on the wall near that corner, and a large iron pulley has been left suspended from a beam above the hole. <br><br>No columns of smoke rise above the village to give away its location, since the Sea of Moving Ice features no wood or peat to burn. The only artificial heat comes from lamps and tiny stoves burning whale oil. The villagers live on fish, whale meat, and seal meat, eaten raw or dried on racks scattered around the village. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Survival) check, a character examining the racks realizes that the village must produce far more food than the number of villagers alone would require. <br><br><h4>Villagers</h4>If the characters approach by the obvious path up the chasm from the ice ledge, they are noticed by the village\u2019s 12 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2I2NzcwMDgxYzUz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>sled dogs</a></strong>. As soon as the dogs begin barking and growling, the whole village turns out armed and alert\u201425 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2IwOWM2ZDQyY2Vi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>tribal warriors</a></strong> (males and females; including the chieftain, Barking Seal), 30 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzI1MzM2ZTc3ZTE3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a></strong> (children), 1 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzE2OGQ0NTI1MzVh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>druid</a></strong> (Bonecarver, tribal shaman, female), and 1 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTBmNWMyYTUwOWVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>gladiator</a> </strong>(Orcaheart, village champion, male). <br><br>The chieftain and shaman do all the talking for the villagers, who speak only their own language, Uluik. The chieftain also knows a little of a rough Illuskan dialect. The Ice Hunters have two main interests: finding out why strangers have come to Oyaviggaton, and getting them to leave. They lie freely and well, telling tales of sea monsters and ravaging scrags in the area. If the characters ask about Arauthator or other dragons, the shaman claims a dragon known as Old White Death was killed a year ago by frost giants. She describes the heap of whale and seal bones on the waterside ice shelf as all that\u2019s left of the monster. Otherwise, the bones are described as evidence of monstrous predators in the area.<br><br>While Barking Seal and Bonecarver speak with the adventurers, the other members of the tribe circle around the party, frowning and muttering as the dogs growl. Eight warriors lope off with their weapons toward the icy staircase and the ice shelf below, where they keep a cautious eye on <em>Frostskimmr</em>. Wizards, sorcerers, and warlocks among the party attract scornful looks. Do your best to communicate an atmosphere of tense hostility to the players.<br><br>Any crew member accompanying the characters can point out that this behavior is highly unusual. Though the Ice Hunters avoid contact with outsiders, they are almost never hostile.<br><br>During this interaction, allow the characters to attempt DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) checks. A character who succeeds notices several villagers slipping away one by one and disappearing into the meeting hall. From the hall, the villagers descend into the ice caves to warn Arauthator\u2019s servants that strangers have come, then quickly slip back up to the surface. <br><br>Encounters in the ice caves assume that the presence of intruders on the iceberg is already known. If the party has maintained stealth since they arrived, they have a chance to surprise creatures in the ice caves.<br><br><h4>An Honorable Duel</h4>The Ice Hunters are determined not to allow the strangers inside the village hall, where they might discover the entrance to the ice caves. They know that letting powerful adventurers get past them into the dragon\u2019s lair means torture or death for every adult and child of the tribe. <br><br>As they stall for time, Barking Seal, Bonecarver, and Orcaheart are also sizing up the adventurers\u2019 strength. If the characters refuse to leave the iceberg, Barking Seal proposes a contest: the village\u2019s champion against any warrior among the strangers. If the champion wins, the characters must hand over some of their fine steel weapons and sail away immediately, never to return. If the adventurer wins, the strangers will have earned their place among the villagers. They can spend the night in the village, after which Bonecarver will answer their questions to the best of her ability. <br><br>If the characters agree to the duel, one of them must fight Orcaheart one-on-one. No magic is allowed, but if the character possesses a magic weapon or magic armor with no obvious effects, the villagers are unlikely to notice. The fight continues until one contestant is unconscious and dying. (Allow Orcaheart to make death saving throws if he drops to 0 hit points.) At that point, the match ends and each combatant\u2019s allies can step in to provide healing and assistance.<br><br>During the fight, a combatant forfeits if he or she gains assistance of any kind from allies. Despite this, however, Bonecarver aids Orcaheart during the fight if she can. She positions herself so that when he is struck, he can fall backward and land in front of her. When she helps him back onto his feet, she surreptitiously casts <em>cure wounds</em>. If a player states specifically that a character is watching the crowd for signs of interference, that character can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Success means that Bonecarver was spotted in the act, though she denies providing assistance if accused of cheating.<br><br><h4>Ice Hunter Hospitality</h4>If Orcaheart loses the match, the Ice Hunters go through the motions of honoring their pledge. They offer to let the characters sleep in the village storage hut, which barely qualifies as shelter. Bonecarver brings them a platter of slightly spoiled raw fish, explaining (truthfully) that her people prefer the tanginess of meat that\u2019s gone past its prime. The fish won\u2019t hurt characters who eat it\u2014but the poison Bonecarver added to it will. The sharp tang of the fish covers the bitter poison so well that a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check or DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is needed to detect it.<br><br>Any character who eats the poisoned fish must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure means the character takes 13 (3d8) poison damage and becomes unconscious for 8 hours. On a successful save, the character takes 9 (2d8) poison damage. If all the characters are rendered unconscious by the poison, they are tied up and carried down to area 1 in the ice caves, where they awaken to see 5 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjgzNDUwMmFkNGJm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ice toads</a></strong> examining their belongings. <br><br><h4>Convincing the Shaman</h4>Of all the Ice Hunters, Bonecarver is the only one whose favor the characters have any chance of winning. She does not initially trust the adventurers, and is as keen to see them depart Oyaviggaton as the rest of her people. However, she knows that the Ice Hunters will eventually perish under Arauthator\u2019s wrath, and she has long dreamed that the totem spirits will send heroes with the strength to best the dragon.<br><br>With effective roleplaying and a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, Bonecarver will meet privately with the adventurers and speak the truth of her people\u2019s plight. A druid, ranger, or some other character who can truthfully express an understanding of the shaman\u2019s animal totem-based faith has advantage on this check. Bonecarver is not willing to risk the lives of her tribesfolk in a battle against the dragon. However, she shows the characters the entrance to the ice caves from her hut and explains what she knows about the caves. This includes their general layout, occupants, and the presence of the \u201chorned lady\u201d (Maccath the Crimson).<br><br><h4>Ice Toads</h4>Arauthator has attracted a number of ice toads to Oyaviggaton, where they help to maintain the iceberg and the dragon\u2019s many treasures and trophies. The ice toads are good at this job, thanks to their exceptionally intelligent leader, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjZkMjdkZjY4ZjU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Marfulb</a>.<br><br>Feeding on seals, sea birds, and fish caught for them by the Ice Hunters, Oyaviggaton\u2019s ice toads are not automatically hostile to strangers. Once characters get inside Arauthator\u2019s lair, they might find that these creatures can be helpful to their quest. Ice toads normally speak only their own obscure language. Those in Oyaviggaton know a little Draconic and Uluik (the language of the Ice Hunters), but their accents are thick and their pronunciation atrocious. Marfulb is fluent in Draconic thanks to many hours spent conversing with Arauthator.<br><br>When the characters encounter ice toads, their intelligence won\u2019t be apparent until they act or attempt to speak. Even then, characters might not recognize the ice toads\u2019 croaking as language. Ice toads move on all fours, but their webbed front feet are surprisingly dexterous. Some carry tools and useful items in pouches slung around their necks.<br></section>", "img": ""}

Two entrances lead into the caves from the village: one hidden inside the meeting hall and the other inside the shaman\u2019s hut. The dragon enters the caves by way of underwater tunnels that connect to his lair chamber, but these are too deep and well hidden to be used by the adventurers. <br><hr><h3>General Features</h3>With its caverns carved out of the glacial depths of the iceberg, every surface in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a> is made of ice.<br><br><strong><em>Ceilings and Walls.</em></strong> Most passages in the ice caves are at least 15 feet wide, and ceilings are 20 feet high unless noted otherwise. The walls are intricately carved with draconic imagery, pillars, cornices, filigrees, buttresses, leering dragon faces, and other decorative flourishes. This work has been done by kobolds in Arauthator\u2019s service, and its quality varies widely. <br><br><strong><em>Floors.</em></strong> The floors inside the iceberg are worn glass-smooth from decades of traffic. Arauthator, the ice trolls, and the ice toads move across the slick ice with ease thanks to claws and bony spurs on their feet that give them traction. The dragon\u2019s kobold servants wear spiky crampons made of animal teeth strapped to their feet. Characters without crampons or the ability to walk on ice treat all areas of the ice caves as difficult terrain. A successful DC 10 Intelligence check allows a character to rig a set of crampons from items in a climbing kit, or to convert a pair of kobold-sized crampons to fit a Medium creature. Snowshoes are of no help inside the iceberg.<br><br>There are no stairs inside the iceberg; the floor slopes between areas of different elevation. Characters can slide down a one-level ramp with ease. Sliding down a two-level ramp (for example, from area 10 to area 9) is automatic if the character is sitting, but requires a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check if the character tries to slide down while standing. Characters equipped with crampons cannot stand, but can treat ramps as difficult terrain. Moving along a two-level ramp with crampons also requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Characters without crampons can climb a one-level ramp with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, or can climb a two-level ramp with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Acrobatics is of no use to these checks, but using a climber\u2019s kit grants advantage on the checks. Any failed Dexterity check to move on a ramp results in the character sliding to the bottom of the ramp and falling prone.<br><br><strong><em>Light.</em></strong> The interior of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a> is filled with dim light by whale-oil lamps that are kept filled and lit by the kobolds. The light is for the benefit of the ice toads, who are the only residents of the caves who need light to see.<br><br><strong><em>Temperature.</em></strong> The ice caverns are cold, with the temperature in most chambers hovering around 20 degrees Fahrenheit. The white dragons, the ice trolls, and the ice toads don\u2019t mind the cold. The kobolds and Maccath the Crimson bundle up in furs and warm their living quarters with small stoves that burn whale oil supplied by the villagers. As long as the characters wear proper cold weather gear, they are at no risk from the cold while in the ice caves.<br><br><strong><em>Visibility.</em></strong> The ice caves are open to the sea, creating banks of vapor that roll constantly through Oyaviggaton\u2019s corridors and chambers. This fog is more common in the low points of the caverns. In areas noted as +10 feet on the map, visibility is unrestricted unless a patch of random fog is encountered. In areas noted as 0 feet, visibility is limited to 75 feet. In areas noted as \u201310 feet or \u201320 feet, visibility is limited to 45 feet.<hr><h3>Random Encounters</h3>In addition to the inhabitants noted in specific areas, the adventurers might run into Arauthator\u2019s minions in any corridor or empty chamber. Whenever the characters move from a chamber into the circular corridor, or from the corridor into a chamber with no occupants, roll a d6. On a roll of 1, an encounter occurs. Then roll on the table to determine the specifics. <br><br><h4>Ice Caves Encounters</h4><table><thead><tr><td>d10</td><td>Encounter or Event</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1-2</td><td>Fog</td></tr><tr><td>3-5</td><td>Kobolds (3d6)</td></tr><tr><td>6-8</td><td>Ice toads (1d6)</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Maccath the Crimson</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Ice trolls (1d2)</td></tr></tbody></table><br><strong><em>Fog.</em></strong> The air is suddenly filled with roiling vapor. Visibility is reduced to 5 feet for 2 minutes or until the characters move 90 feet away.<br><br><strong><em>Kobolds.</em></strong> Arauthator brought a pack of unwitting kobolds to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a> generations ago, and the creatures have been serving him in the frigid cold ever since. In the event of an encounter, a squad of 3d6 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWM0MWVmNDAyYzk0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>kobolds</a></strong> is working in or passing through the area. If the characters are dressed as Ice Hunter villagers or are wearing some other appropriate disguise, the kobolds eye them warily but don\u2019t immediately sound an alarm. Make a single Wisdom check for the kobolds with a DC equal to the lowest of the characters\u2019 checks to disguise themselves. The kobolds\u2019 Wisdom modifier is \u20132, but they have advantage on this check because of their numbers. If the check is successful (or if the characters aren\u2019t disguised), the kobolds launch a single volley of sling stones at the intruders, then flee in as many directions as possible to report the intrusion to the ice toads or ice trolls.<br><br><strong><em>Ice Toads.</em></strong> A crew of 1d6 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjgzNDUwMmFkNGJm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ice toads</a></strong> is working in this area or passing along the corridor. Disguises are ineffective against the ice toads, which know what creatures live in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a> at any given time. If they see anything unexpected\u2014even Ice Hunter villagers entering the caves without permission\u2014they stop what they\u2019re doing and observe the characters\u2019 actions, asking questions if they can. The ice toads flee to the ice trolls if threatened, fighting only if they must. <br><br>The ice toads speak their own language, plus enough Draconic and Uluik to communicate with Arauthator, the kobolds, and the Ice Hunters. They work for Arauthator but have no special devotion to the dragon. If a fight is coming, their loyalty goes to whomever they expect to win. That means the dragon, unless the characters somehow impress them. <br><br><strong><em>Maccath the Crimson.</em></strong> Maccath often wanders the ice caves, deep in thought. On meeting strangers, her reaction is oddly subdued. See area 10 for more details on Maccath\u2019s situation.<br><br><strong><em>Ice Trolls.</em></strong> Encountered singly or in small roving gangs, <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGI1Mjk1MzM5OWVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ice trolls</a></strong> are ordinary trolls with bluish skin and immunity to cold damage. Unless any ice toads are nearby to intervene, the ice trolls treats any creature not a kobold, an ice toad, Maccath, or an Ice Hunter as an intruder. For more information on the ice trolls working for Arauthator, see area 12. <hr><h3>1. Entrance from Hut</h3>Inside the hut of the shaman Bonecarver, old furs heaped atop poles are laid across an opening leading down to the ice caves. Steps are cut into the wall of the chute, creating steep, icy stairs that drop down 100 feet in a tight spiral. Because this entrance is seldom used, the steps become increasingly obscured by frost as the characters descend. At the 40-foot mark, a character must attempt a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to maintain a grip on the dangerously uneven footholds. Failure means the character loses his or her footing, sliding and tumbling 60 feet to the bottom and taking 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage. Characters can mitigate this danger by roping themselves together or using a climber\u2019s kit. Past the 40-foot mark, the steps improve again so that no further checks are necessary.<br><br>The chute and its icy stairs end at the ceiling. A sturdy ladder then descends into the approximate center of a rectangular chamber. The exit to the corridor is an icy, 15-foot-wide passageway sloping downward. <br><br>The chamber is empty except for a dozen baskets woven from leather strips and walrus ribs, stacked in the north corner. These contain frozen fish and a few skin-wrapped bundles of rotting shark meat that the Ice Hunters consider a delicacy.<br><hr><h3>2. Entrance from the Village Hall</h3>Hidden beneath the planks in the back corner of the village hall, this entrance to the ice caves consists of a chute carved with icy stairs descending 100 feet in a tight spiral. This route is used regularly to bring supplies to Arauthator\u2019s minions, so the steps are clear and easy to climb. Supplies are carried down strapped to villagers\u2019 backs, or lowered in baskets with the pulley and rope in the village hall.<br><br>This chamber is empty except for three bundles of rolled-up sealskins sitting where the ladder descends from the chute above to the approximate center of the room. Additionally, a bed of piled furs has been arranged in the southwest corner, from which the sound of loud coughing can be heard when the characters enter the chamber. Villagers who suffer disease or injury beyond Bonecarver\u2019s limited healing ability are quarantined here in the relative warmth of the caves. The coughing villager is named <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjAzNzkzMjIyOGY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Mend-nets</a> (<strong>tribal warrior</strong>). <br><br>Mend-nets is naturally suspicious of strangers, but if any character can use <em>lesser restoration</em> to cure his disease, he becomes a trustworthy ally. He won\u2019t do anything to hurt the village or the tribe, but he hates the kobolds who live in the caves. The ice toads likewise repulse him, though they also ignore him. The ice trolls terrify him, and he has awoken several times to find a troll hungrily peering at him from the tunnel leading to the trolls\u2019 lair (area 12). He tells the characters that the creatures of the caves have been warned of their presence, but the only chambers he knows anything about besides this one are areas 1, 3, and 7.<br><hr><h3>3. Larder</h3>The supplies that the villagers provide for Arauthator and his minions are stored here\u2014mostly dried and frozen fish, whale, seal, walrus, and giant squid, plus furs that the kobolds fashion into protective clothing. Fish organs, shells, bones, soft stone, and other sundries are stored in smaller quantities, and are used by the ice toads to make ink, brushes, parchment, and other items for their work. A few seemingly inexplicable items are stored away from the other supplies, including a single steel gauntlet, a silver brooch containing a cameo, the brass hilt of a dueling knife, and a decorative belt buckle\u2014bits and pieces that the villagers have pulled from the stomachs of sharks or giant octopi that have fed on explorers lost to the Sea of Moving Ice.<br><br>Also stockpiled in this chamber are coils of rope, spikes, and a few pulleys. It\u2019s clear at a glance that this gear has come from the south and was not made by the Ice Hunters. The kobolds use this equipment when something\u2014or someone\u2014needs to be lowered down into Arauthator\u2019s lair through area 6. The pulley is attached to the iron hook in the ceiling of that chamber.<br><hr><h3>4. Kobolds\u2019 Den</h3>Arauthator\u2019s kobold servants live in this chamber. <br><br><blockquote>A dozen kobolds occupy this disheveled and filthy chamber. Half-eaten fish heads and gnawed seal flippers are tossed into corners or carelessly strewn around matted heaps of furs, which would undoubtedly smell as bad as they look if not for the cold. </blockquote><br>The chamber holds 12 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWM0MWVmNDAyYzk0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>kobolds</a></strong> when the characters enter. A few are sleeping but most are tossing knucklebones, sharpening blades, sewing clothing, carving whalebone, or picking on each other. See \u201cRandom Encounters\u201d above for guidelines on how the kobolds respond to intruders. <br><br>If the characters spend a few minutes searching the area, a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check suggests that approximately two dozen kobolds live in this chamber. Their only possessions of value are a number of walrus tusks carved with draconic imagery, six of which are of sufficient artistry to fetch 200 gp each from a suitable collector.<br><hr><h3>5. Junk Room</h3>The kobolds throw their litter, food scraps, waste, worn-out boots, and other useless junk into this cavernous chamber. Its pit-like floor is filled to a depth of several feet, courtesy of minions that have been serving Arauthator in this iceberg for centuries. The trash floor of the chamber can be safely traversed, but there is nothing of value here.<br><hr><h3>6. The Chute</h3>This narrow cavern is the access point to the lair of Arauthator below.<br><br><blockquote>This chamber feels far colder than any area of the ice caves you\u2019ve explored so far. The cold issues from a yawning pit in the floor that twists down into darkness, and above which a heavy iron hook is anchored in the ice of the ceiling. A five-foot-wide walkway extends around both sides of the pit, connecting this entrance to an exit across the room. Carved into the ice of the walls are images of white dragons in flight.</blockquote><br>A visual inspection from either doorway indicates that the walkway looks safe enough\u2014aside from being icy, narrow, and adjacent to an apparently bottomless pit. The walkway that crosses the east and north sides of the chamber is, in fact, safe, and characters can walk along it without difficulty. The walkway that crosses the west and south walls is weakened and dangerous. When a character reaches the bend in the walkway, have the player roll any die. If an odd number is rolled, a portion of the wall crumbles, and any creature on the walkway must attempt a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed off the walkway into the chute. <br><br>The chute drops 60 feet to the top of the ice platform in area 16 in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YmU3ZDFlOTUwMjVk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Arauthator's Lair</a>. A creature tipped into the chute slides as much as falls, taking only 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage when hitting bottom. The creature must then attempt a Dexterity saving throw or fall off the ice platform; see area 16 for more information. A creature that jumps into the chute on purpose takes half damage from the descent and has advantage on the saving throw to stay on the ice platform.<br><hr><h3>7. Hall of Giants</h3>The bodies of some of the frost giants Arauthator has fought and killed over the centuries are on display in this chamber, frozen into crystal-clear ice walls. Visibility at this level is only 45 feet, so characters won\u2019t be able to see much from the doorway. As they move into the chamber, the shape of the first frost giant becomes dimly visible at a distance of 60 feet. At 45 feet, the figure is easily mistakable for a living frost giant standing perfectly still. At 30 feet, the characters recognize that the giant is dead and frozen, seeing its torn armor and the awful claw wounds in its pale blue flesh. The hall displays the bodies of eight frost giants, one fire giant, and one cloud giant.<br><br>When the characters arrive in this area, 8 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWM0MWVmNDAyYzk0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>kobolds</a></strong> are working in the chamber, polishing and maintaining the ice. If they recognize the characters as intruders, they try to keep away from them in the fog, then slip out of the chamber when they can. <br><hr><h3>8. Trophy Hall</h3>Trophies of Arauthator\u2019s many battles are displayed in this chamber. Visibility is 45 feet, so the characters won\u2019t be able to see much from the doorway. Among the creatures frozen here in death are two remorhazes, a trio of behirs, five abominable yetis, and a giant squid of jaw-dropping size. A complete longship with sail raised is also on display here. The ship clearly will not fit through any of the iceberg\u2019s entrances; it was painstakingly disassembled outside and reassembled here by the kobolds. Characters who know ships can see mistakes in the rigging and hull planking, but it\u2019s passably good work for a display.<br><br>Of more immediate interest is the open chest of gold and jewels sitting on the ship\u2019s deck. The chest contains 375 gp, 1,480 ep, and 495 sp, plus jewelry and precious objects worth another 225 gp. A character examining the chest without disturbing it or the contents can estimate its value at between 1,000 and 1,500 gp with a successful DC 10 Intelligence check.<br><br>If the chest or any of the treasure it contains\u2014even a single coin\u2014is removed from the ship, Arauthator senses it immediately and dispatches 2 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGI1Mjk1MzM5OWVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ice trolls</a></strong> (see area 12) to investigate.<br><hr><h3>9. Unused Chamber</h3>This chamber is empty, awaiting the day when Arauthator\u2019s collection of trophies overflows areas 7 and 8.<br><hr><h3>10. Maccath the Crimson</h3>If <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGU2NWMzM2Q5OGJi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Maccath the Crimson</a> hasn\u2019t been encountered elsewhere in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a>, the characters meet her here. <br><br>At the top of the ramp from area 9, 1 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGI1Mjk1MzM5OWVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ice troll</a></strong> (see area 12) stands guard over this cavern. It positions itself around the corner so it can\u2019t be seen until intruders reach the top of the ramp.<br><br><blockquote>The empty ice floor of this chamber holds a most unexpected sight. A large shelter is seemingly built of scraps, and in the style of the tents used by the desert nomads of Calimshan, some two thousand miles to the south.</blockquote><br>Maccath\u2019s shelter is made from huge tapestries and carpets draped across a frame of whale ribs, and stands 8 feet tall, 20 feet wide, and 30 feet long. The bottoms of the walls drape down onto the ground, leaving no gaps underneath. The tent has no obvious entrance, but a character can slide between any two overlapping tapestries to emerge inside the shelter. <br><br>When the characters step inside, read or paraphrase the following.<br><br><blockquote>The interior of the shelter is surprisingly warm, thanks to a small stove and simple lamps burning aromatic whale oil. Carpets are heaped on the floor in thick layers, and tapestries from every culture in Faer\u00fbn hang suspended from a sturdy frame of whale ribs.<br><br>Books and scrolls are stacked neatly on tables and reading stands made of hide and whalebone. The only furnishings in the shelter not made from these natural materials are the carpets and tapestries, and a portable writing desk that appears to have been taken from a sailing ship.</blockquote><br>If this is the characters\u2019 first meeting with <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGU2NWMzM2Q5OGJi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Maccath the Crimson</a>, add:<br><br><blockquote>Seated at the writing desk is a female tiefling wearing a blazing crimson cloak over tailored furs. The cloak is fastened with a silver-and-ivory brooch bearing a design reminiscent of a stylized, branching tree\u2014the symbol of the Arcane Brotherhood. Two kobold attendants stand nearby, glancing nervously between you and the tiefling. After a few moments, the tiefling looks up with an expression of pale disinterest and asks, \u201cHave you come to save me or kill me? Not that there will be much difference between the two.\u201d </blockquote><br>When Maccath arrived at <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a> three years ago, Arauthator would normally have killed her without a second thought. However, the brooch of the Arcane Brotherhood she wore suggested to Arauthator that the tiefling might present a solution to two problems. First, the dragon possessed numerous items and writings stolen from the Arcane Brotherhood, some of which defied his understanding even after decades of study. Second, Arauthator had long sought a way to help his mate Arveiaturace overcome her grieving over the death of the wizard she once served. Replacing that dead wizard with a living one\u2014and a member of the Arcane Brotherhood at that\u2014seemed a perfect solution. <br><br>Maccath was smart enough to convince the dragon that his offer had won her over, expecting that she would eventually be able to seek a means of escape from the iceberg. However, she has so far been thwarted by Arauthator\u2019s potent magic\u2014including spells and rituals stolen from the Arcane Brotherhood\u2014which have kept her sealed and helpless in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a>, invisible to scrying and unable to use sending to call for help. Before he turns Maccath over to Arveiaturace, Arauthator has had the tiefling deciphering his stolen writings, though the work has gone slowly thanks to the inherent complexity and danger of the material. Maccath is studying one of the stolen scrolls when the characters walk in.<br><br>If the characters announced their presence by fighting the ice troll, the 2 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWM0MWVmNDAyYzk0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>kobolds</a></strong> will be visibly agitated, even though Maccath shows little concern. The kobolds have been directed to stay with the tiefling and follow her orders, which mostly means undertaking errands to the scriptorium (area 11). She also relies on them for cooking, housekeeping, and other mundane chores. The moment the characters make it clear that they are here to rescue Maccath, the kobolds make a dash for area 12. They alert the ice trolls unless they are stopped.<br><br><h4>Maccath\u2019s Bargain</h4>Though she is a prisoner, Maccath has become obsessed with completing Arauthator\u2019s challenging magical translations. Like most members of the Arcane Brotherhood, she is dedicated to the point of arrogance, believing that even if she is fated to die as a dragon\u2019s plaything, she will have accomplished something magnificent first. <br><br>As such, the tiefling sets out terms for her rescue, saying that she won\u2019t leave <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a> without bringing along as much of the Arcane Brotherhood\u2019s stolen property as she can. If the characters agree, Maccath shares the following information:<br><ul><li>Arauthator is currently in area 20 of his lair, close to the entrance beneath the scriptorium (area 11).</li><li>Most of the material stolen from the Hosttower is in the scriptorium, but a few items might be in Arauthator\u2019s lair (see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDUxNmVmNmY2NDBj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Arauthator's Treasure</a>).</li><li>If the party seems intent on fighting Arauthator, Maccath offers them a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzRlYzNlODMwM2Ji ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>ring of cold resistance</a></em> and two <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDc5YmUzYTY0ZGQ4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>arrows of dragon slaying</a> that she has crafted during her captivity. Though these items and her draconic knowledge give the characters an edge, she warns the party that Arauthator has devoured almost every hero he has faced.</li><li>Maccath knows the general layout of the dragon\u2019s cavern but not its specific dangers. Arauthator has never allowed her out of his sight in the lair. In particular, she knows nothing of the scrags in area 15 or the traps in area 18.</li><li>Two entrances lead to Arauthator\u2019s lair\u2014one in the adjoining scriptorium and the other in area 6. </li><li>Arauthator moves in and out of the lair using underwater passages.</li><li>The <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjM1NWY5NDNhOTlk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Draakhorn</a></em> was here when Maccath came to Oyaviggaton, but a group of humans wearing distinctive robes came to the iceberg half a year ago. After negotiation with Arauthator, they took the device away. (The characters recognize The Cult of the Dragon regalia in Maccath\u2019s description of the humans.) In addition to this, Maccath can tell the characters all the information about the <em>Draakhorn</em> in the item description.</li><li>Trying to escape from the iceberg on a ship would be suicidal while Arauthator is able to attack from the air. The dragon is content to let his minions deal with intruders, but he will be alerted if the characters flee.</li><li>Even if the adventurers have not alerted any of the dragon\u2019s servants, Maccath\u2019s absence would be reported within a day. When that happens, the dragon will come looking for her and whoever helped her escape.</li></ul>Maccath knows that surprise is the characters\u2019 best weapon for challenging the dragon, and that he will not risk dying over this single lair. Though he hates the idea of abandoning a home with its treasure and trophies, if bested by the adventurers, Arauthator will flee to one of his other lairs. <br><hr><h3>11. Scriptorium</h3>Though this chamber is deeper than the adjacent caverns, no mist hangs in the air here. <br><br><blockquote>Three shelves stand in this otherwise empty cavern, cobbled together out of salvaged wood, whale bone, pieces of giants\u2019 armor, and even the frozen limbs of yetis. A number of scrolls, books, parchments, and folios are carefully arranged on the shelves, all bearing the markings of magical writing.</blockquote><br>If Maccath is with the characters, she can direct them to the items stolen from the Hosttower of the Arcane. She cautions the characters not to read or even peruse the material for their own safety. The writings are laced with diabolical lore that is anathema to the mortal mind. <br><br>Characters unable to read magic can\u2019t make any headway in the books. A character who can read magic who examines the writings must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Success indicates that the character recognizes the danger and stops reading. Failure indicates the character absorbs the power of the fiendish lore and suffers a psychic shock. While suffering this shock, the character has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and must attempt a DC 10 Constitution check to cast a spell. On a failed check, the spell cannot be cast, though the spell slot is not expended. The character can make another saving throw to end the effect each time he or she finishes a long rest. <br><br>Arcane spellcasters can find much of value in this scriptorium, along with much that\u2019s worthless. Arauthator has collected many spellbooks from slain wizards over the centuries. More importantly for the party\u2019s immediate benefit, he also collected dozens of scrolls. Though many of those here have deteriorated from dampness or age, characters who spend a few minutes searching can find ten scrolls: <em>gaseous form</em>, <em>haste</em>, <em>protection from energy</em>, <em>water breathing</em>, <em>Evard\u2019s black tentacles</em>, <em>fire shield</em>, <em>wall of fire</em>, <em>hold monster</em>, <em>chain lightning</em>, and <em>disintegrate</em>.<br><br><h4>Access to Arauthator\u2019s Lair</h4>Near the western end of the scriptorium, a 15-foot-wide chute leads down to area 19 of Arauthator\u2019s lair. The dragon can clamber up and down this passage without difficulty. Characters trained in Athletics can climb down the chute using crampons or some other device to grip the wall. Other characters can climb down only with ropes, pitons, and other climbing gear. The chute descends 60 feet to the roof of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YmU3ZDFlOTUwMjVk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area 19</a>, after which characters must drop 15 feet to the ice platform. <br><br>Before the characters head down into the cavern, Maccath tells them they have no easy way back up to these chambers. Old White Death doesn\u2019t want anyone\u2014intruders or guests\u2014to be able to easily leave his lair.<br><hr><h3>12. Ice Trolls</h3>The ice trolls that Arauthator has gathered to his service use this hall as their residence, and no other creatures are permitted here. An ice troll has bluish, translucent skin and immunity to cold damage; it otherwise has the statistics of an ordinary troll.<br><br>A minimum of 2 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NGI1Mjk1MzM5OWVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ice trolls</a></strong> are here when characters first enter, but 3 or more can be placed in this area at your discretion (and depending on whether the adventurers meet conditions that might lead to fighting; see below). <br><br><blockquote>This cavernous chamber is filled with drifting mist that shrouds a field of ice pillars rising from floor to ceiling. The muffled silence beyond is broken only by the sound of running water.</blockquote><br>Ice pillars and pressure ridges form razor-sharp crags that loom out of the roiling fog. Streams of crackling water, magically flowing even at subzero temperatures, course thickly through the hollows beneath wind-driven, icy snow.<br><br>From the entrance, only swirling fog can be seen and only the wind can be heard. If Maccath or any ice toad is with the party, they advise the characters in the strongest possible terms to stay out of this chamber. Those who venture here are silently surrounded and ambushed by the ice trolls. The trolls hungrily pursue the adventurers if they flee, but they heed the ice toads and refrain from attacking if the toads command them to.<br><br>The trolls speak Giant and understand a little bit of the Draconic tongue. They are willing to trade or bargain with characters who prove too difficult to kill. Only the verifiable offer of food and treasure can convince the trolls to turn against Arauthator.<br><hr><h3>13. Ice Toad Workplace</h3>Giant ice toads serve Arauthator as overseers at <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a>. They manage the labor of the kobolds, direct the Ice Hunter villagers to provide the lair with food and other supplies, and have the patience required to deal with the ornery ice trolls.<br><br><blockquote>A bizarre sight greets you in this rough-walled chamber. About a dozen giant toads with thick, mottled white hides are at work here, scribing strange writing into the ice of the walls, or onto weathered parchment and stone tablets. A few toads transfer parchments and tablets into and out of floor-to-ceiling cubbyholes cut into the ice along the entire southern wall. </blockquote><br>A total of 11 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjgzNDUwMmFkNGJm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ice toads</a></strong> work in this chamber, scribing records and tallies into the ice using sharpened antlers or their own claws. They also maintain rough maps of the Sea of Moving Ice based on reports from the Ice Hunter villagers. At regular intervals, their temporary records are transferred to more permanent form.<br><br>See \u201cRandom Encounters\u201d (above) for guidelines on how the giant ice toads respond to intruders. The characters\u2019 best chance to avoid a fight in this area\u2014and to keep the toads from alerting the ice trolls\u2014is to win the ice toads to their cause by treating with their leader, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjZkMjdkZjY4ZjU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Marfulb</a>.<br><br>The average ice toad is smart, but their leader Marfulb is exceptional (Intelligence 13). Her knack for organization and governance had no outlet until her path crossed Arauthator\u2019s on the Sea of Moving Ice, and she has served as the seneschal of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a> for the four decades since. Not even Arauthator understands the workings of Oyaviggaton as well as Marfulb, who knows the contents and value of every pack, chest, and heap of coins in the iceberg down to the last copper piece.<br><br><h4>Marfulb\u2019s Lore</h4>In addition to data about Arauthator\u2014his treasures, mating habits, and epic battles with frost giants and other monsters\u2014the information amassed by the ice toads includes exhaustive details on the ever-changing Sea of Moving Ice, the weather north of the Spine of the World, and the culture of the elusive Ice Hunters. Marfulb feels great satisfaction in her life\u2019s work, but she knows too little about society south of the Spine of the World to sense its full importance. <br><br>Characters equipped with a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTEzNDc2NDhlYjQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>bag of holding</a></em> could take all the parchments and stone slabs with them when they leave <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a>. The Arcane Brotherhood would regard the lore as one of the most amazing works of natural philosophy in existence (once it is painstakingly translated from the ice toads\u2019 unique language), and they would clamor to meet and praise <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjZkMjdkZjY4ZjU1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Marfulb</a>. Without a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NTEzNDc2NDhlYjQ1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>bag of holding</a></em>, the collection is too large to move.<br><hr id=\"userscript-horizontalrule\"><h3>14. Ice Toad Lair</h3>This freezing, miserable chamber makes a perfect home for the ice toads, but is presently empty. None of the toads\u2019 belongings here has value as loot, but they make a strange and curious collection. Such objects include walrus-tooth wart scrapers, spears fashioned from narwhal horn, oddly shaped furniture sculpted into the icy floor instead of rising above it, writing implements carved from baleen and shaped for a webbed hand, and art objects that combine carved whalebone, driftwood, and mundane items such as silverware and glass stoppers salvaged from shipwrecks. <br></section>", "img": "modules/mod-rise-of-tiamat/journal/002_-_Episode_2_3A_The_Sea_of_Moving_Ice/003_-_Ice_Caves/avatar.png"}

Arauthator and the scrags move across the slick ice with ease thanks to their claws, but characters without crampons or the ability to walk on ice treat all areas of the lair cavern as difficult terrain. See the \u201cGeneral Features\u201d of the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDA3MDJkMGEyNjMy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Ice Caves</a> for information on crampons. Snowshoes are of no help in the lair.<br><br>The terrain levels represented on the map of the cavern show increments of 8 feet. The elevation of the floor results from the ice splitting and splintering, so the ledges are abrupt and have a distinctly step-like appearance. Characters can drop down a level without difficulty. Scrambling up a level requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check; the climber has advantage on the check if equipped with crampons or climbing gear.<br><br><strong><em>Light.</em></strong> The lair cavern is normally dark. All description assumes that the characters have a light source or darkvision.<br><br><strong><em>Temperature.</em></strong> The lair cavern is colder than the tunnels and chambers above it. The cavern is a bone-chilling 0 degrees Fahrenheit. Area 20 is even colder.<br><br><strong><em>Visibility.</em></strong> Banks of vapor roll through the cavern, limiting visibility to 60 feet for characters with light.<hr><h3>15. Scrags\u2019 Lair</h3>This corner of the cavern is home to 2 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NDBmNjAyYjEyNmM2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>scrags</a></strong> that Arauthator allows to live in his lair, provided they guard it in his absence. These aquatic trolls can breathe underwater and have a swim speed of 30 feet.<br> <br>If the characters approach, the scrags duck into hiding places, then attempt to attack from ambush and claim an unexpected meal.<br><hr><h3>16. Ice Pillars</h3>Pillars and platforms of ice jut up from the floor in this area of the cavern. Climbing an ice pillar more than 8 feet tall requires a climber\u2019s kit and a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.<br><br>A creature dropping down the chute from area 6 lands on the top level of the large ice platform in the southeast part of the cavern, 16 feet above the cavern floor. The creature must then succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to stay on the platform. (A creature that intentionally jumps down the chute takes half damage from the descent and has advantage on this saving throw.) If the saving throw fails, the creature slides off the top level of the icy platform and hits the second level, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage and falling prone. <br><br>Any creature falling to the cavern floor attracts the attention of the scrags in area 15.<br><hr><h3>17. The Icewolf\u2019s Spine</h3>This jagged ridge of ice divides the cavern into sections. Climbing up to at least the 8-foot level and moving along the ridge is the only safe way to get from area 15 or 16 into area 19 or 20 without encountering the traps in areas 18a and 18b. <br><br>Unlike other ledges in the cavern, the horizontal surfaces of the Icewolf\u2019s Spine aren\u2019t level. The denizens of the lair can traverse the ledges without difficulty, but any other creature that moves more than 15 feet during a round must make a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Failure indicates that the creature loses its footing and falls to the next level below, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage and landing prone. Wearing crampons grants advantage on this check.<br><hr><h3>18a. The Gullet</h3>This narrow passage is rigged with a magic trap. When the first character passes through the narrowest point of the passage, the entire area of the passage fills with a <em>stinking cloud</em> for 1 minute. <br><br>Arauthator immediately becomes aware of intruders if the <em>stinking cloud</em> is triggered. The dragon does not set off the trap if it moves through the area.<br><hr><h3>18b. The Throat</h3>This narrow passage is rigged with a magic trap. When the first character moves through the narrowest point of the passage, a <em>slow</em> spell is triggered, targeting every creature in the area. Creatures affected by the spell suffer its effects for 1 minute.<br><br>Arauthator immediately becomes aware of intruders if the <em>slow</em> spell is triggered. The dragon does not set off the trap if it moves through the area.<br><hr><h3>19. The Perch</h3>Arauthator sometimes sleeps on this vast ice shelf, but more often he spends his time lounging in area 20. Much of the treasure the dragon keeps at <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a> is stashed here and on the ledges above. See<strong> </strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDUxNmVmNmY2NDBj ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Arauthator's Treasure</a>.<br><hr id=\"userscript-horizontalrule\"><h3>20. Arauthator\u2019s Abyss</h3>The western end of the lair cavern is where Arauthator (an <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGNmZTU2YzhiMGM3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>adult white dragon</a></strong>) spends most of his time at Oyaviggaton. Gold, jewels, and other treasure lies scattered on the floor and frozen into the walls of this vast chamber. <br><br>It is noticeably colder here than anywhere else in the iceberg, reaching \u201310 degrees Fahrenheit. Any character in an area where the temperature is below 0 degrees Fahrenheit must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour. Characters without cold weather gear automatically fail this save. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion. <br><br>When the characters face off against Arauthator, the dragon roars so loudly that the whole iceberg reverberates with his rage. This calls the ice trolls from <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDA3MDJkMGEyNjMy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area 12</a>, which arrive 5 rounds later.<br><br>Pools of slush spread across the floor of the cavern, prevented from freezing by the seawater\u2019s high salt content. One such pool, in the westernmost angle of the cavern, conceals a flooded passage connecting to the Sea of Moving Ice. This is Arauthator\u2019s customary entrance and exit. When the dragon is reduced to 100 hit points or fewer and facing three or more foes, he dives for this exit and escapes into the frozen sea. If the dragon flees, the ice trolls retreat as well.<br></section>", "img": "modules/mod-rise-of-tiamat/journal/002_-_Episode_2_3A_The_Sea_of_Moving_Ice/004_-_Arauthator_27s_Lair/avatar.png"}

Varram is desperate to retrieve the mask before Severin discovers it is missing, and so he has created the pretense of taking a group of trusted followers to seek out a site of ancient magic in the Serpent Hills, which he claims will help the cult in its plans to summon Tiamat. In truth, Varram is seeking the Tomb of Diderius\u2014site of an ancient divination pool that he hopes will show him the location of the lost mask.<br><br>Harper agents have heard rumors of the theft of the <em>White Dragon Mask</em>, and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDY2ZmM5YjA3MmQ0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Leosin Erlanthar</a> has recently learned that the dwarf Varram was seen in the trade settlement of Boareskyr Bridge, near the Serpent Hills. With the Harpers already spread far and wide on their intelligence-gathering missions, the adventurers are a perfect choice to pursue the wyrmspeaker.<hr><h3>Following the Trail</h3>Leosin Erlanthar contacts the party during a council session in Waterdeep. After filling them in on the rumors that Varram has lost the <em>White Dragon Mask</em> and gone abroad in search of it, he sends the characters to Boareskyr Bridge, instructing them to seek information on Varram\u2019s recent movements and probable destination.<br><br>This episode sees the characters journey from Boareskyr Bridge to a forgotten Anaurian ruin in the Serpent Hills. The divination pool that Varram seeks is there\u2014but so too is a clan of yuan-ti that are a threat to the wyrmspeaker and the adventurers alike. <hr><h3>Boareskyr Bridge</h3>Boareskyr Bridge bears the name of a now-vanished realm north and east of the Trade Way. The bridge provides access across the Winding Water and is a major landmark. Constructed of black granite, it bears sculpted images of the deities Cyric and Bhaal, commemorating the legendary battle they fought on the bridge during the Time of Troubles.<br><br>This way station settlement is little more than a collection of tents, wagons, and caravans providing food, fresh mounts, and other services to travelers. A contingent of paladins from the theocracy of Elturgard maintains watch over the bridge in a newly built keep<br><br><h4>Bolo\u2019s Tentside Inn</h4>Bolo\u2019s Tentside Inn is a rough-and-tumble establishment set up in a large pavilion near the center of Boareskyr\u2019s tent city. When the characters make inquiries about Varram, they are directed to Bolo\u2019s and its female halfling proprietor.<br><br><blockquote>\u201cA dwarf in purple robes? Oh, I saw him. He was asking about escorts into the hills, when this hooded fellow starts asking him his business. The dwarf looked him straight in the eye, then pulled out his dagger and stabbed the tall fellow dead! He was one of the scaled folk of the Serpent Hills, come down to spy on us! That dwarf\u2019s a hero, make no mistake. But he and his entourage took off straight away for the hills then, quick as cats!\u201d</blockquote><br>Varram\u2019s only goal in killing the yuan-ti spy was stopping word of his movements from reaching the Serpent Hills before he got there, but it has made him something of a local hero. Bolo is happy to share what she knows as long as the characters don\u2019t let on that they intend to harm the dwarf.<br><br>Varram traveled with more than a dozen other companions, including a handful of cloaked and hooded warriors. She assumed them to be barbarian mercenaries, but Varram is actually traveling under the protection of a force of bearded devils. The dwarf headed into the Serpent Hills after killing the yuan-ti.<hr><h3>The Serpent Hills</h3>Good weather and the fact that Varram and his large party were moving with haste makes their trail into the hills easy to follow. From Boareskyr Bridge, the adventurers pursue the dwarf into the Serpent Hills\u2014a swath of badlands, mesas, and rocky plateaus sprinkled with trees and tall grass. Varram\u2019s trail leads some sixty-five miles north-northeast. <br><br>Lizardfolk and nagas, trolls and giants, and the treacherous yuan-ti all lurk in the Serpent Hills, amid the tombs and ruined settlements of more than one fallen civilization. As the characters pursue Varram, roll a d20 every 6 hours of travel; an encounter occurs on a roll of 17\u201320. Determine the encounter by rolling on the table below.<br><br><h4>Serpent Hills Encounters</h4><table><thead><tr><td>d8</td><td>Encounter</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Humanoids (1d6)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Herd mammals (5d6)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Hill giants (1d2)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Unmarked grave</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Shrine</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Vultures (3d6)</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Ruined settlement</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Lizardfolk (2d8)</td></tr></tbody></table><br><strong><em>Humanoids</em></strong>. Humanoids ranging into the Serpent Hills might be treasure hunters, escaped slaves from the monstrous land of Najara, or scouts from Elturgard keeping watch on yuan-ti activity.<br><br><strong><em>Herd Mammals</em></strong>. Packs of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGQwYjVhZGNiM2Ez ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>goats</a>, antelope, and other herd mammals range across the Serpent Hills.

The party comes across one or two hill giants gorging on a fallen herd animal. When the giants notice the adventurers, they see the opportunity for another meal.

A low rise covered in hastily collected rocks marks the resting place of one of the many explorers to have fallen in the Serpent Hills.

An isolated shrine to one of the many lost gods of Netheril or Anauria rises up out of the desert.

Originally part of the manse the wizard Diderius built around the mystical divination pool, the complex was converted to a crypt only after his death. The crypt looks down over the ruins of the town that grew up around the magic pool to cater to those who came seeking Diderius\u2019s wisdom.<br><br>The town once nestled into a canyon between two bluffs, but only a few ruined stone structures and the slab foundations of administrative and temple buildings now remain. Cave entrances dot the bluffs, marking former residences and simple tombs. None of the ruins hold anything of value or interest, but the caves offer safe places for the party to rest.<br><br>Knowledge of the settlement that once stood here has been lost to all except Ilda, a ghostly librarian in area 9 of the crypt, who has answers to many forgotten questions. As well, though few seek the pool these days, a small yuan-ti colony known as Ss\u2019tck\u2019al has arisen behind the crypt. The yuan-ti use humanoid sacrifices to power the divination pool\u2019s magic, learning dark secrets that fuel their insidious plots.<hr><h3>General Features</h3>Unless otherwise specified, the floor and walls of the dungeon are sandstone blocks and flagstones. The walls are cool to the touch and the air is cold. <br><br><strong><em>Ceilings</em></strong>. 10 feet high unless otherwise noted.<br><br><strong><em>Light</em></strong>. None, unless outdoors or otherwise specified.<br><br><strong><em>Regional Effects</em></strong>. When Diderius died, those who honored him in life transformed him into a special <strong><strong>mummy lord</strong></strong> whose magic pervades his tomb. Since Diderius is neutral rather than evil, the area lacks dark magic common to other mummy-lord tombs. A few chambers of the tomb have the appearance of opulent and well-kept rooms suitable for a noble archmage. This effect is an illusion, however, failing to cover the rank scent of dust and decay. Diderius\u2019s magic also guides those who show proper respect.<hr><h4>1. Entrance Plaza</h4><blockquote>The entrance to Diderius\u2019s tomb stands in what was once a large paved plaza. The remains of a fountain are now little more than a stone circle set around a crumbling hole in the ground leading to a well deep below. Two stone statues stand in the courtyard, rising twenty feet high. Behind them, a forty-foot high edifice is carved into the cliff side, dominated by relief columns carved with strange, otherworldly scenes.</blockquote><br>The left-hand colossus is a bearded human male wearing exotic clothes, but its face is smashed beyond recognition. It holds a balance in its right hand and a cudgel at its side, its left hand raised as if in warning. The colossus to the right of the entrance is a young human male wearing similarly exotic clothing, the left half of its head cracked off and lying at its feet. The statue holds a shepherd\u2019s crook in its left hand and a sword at its waist, its right hand raised in warning as well.<br><br>The relief-carved scenes around the entrance depict things Diderius glimpsed in the divination pool, including other worlds and planes that never came to be. Use your imagination when describing these scenes. The entrance to the crypt is 30 feet up atop a stone stairwell that stops 10 feet short of a platform jutting out from the cliff face. Varram\u2019s cultists (see below) have left a ladder leaning against the edifice that allows characters to climb up to the entrance. <br><br><h4>Cultist Campsite and Ruined Fountain</h4>Varram\u2019s cultists have made camp in the plaza near the ruined fountain. A campfire is burning down here, and three bedrolls show where the rearguard cultists are camped. Seven shallow graves have been dug east of the campsite\u2014casualties from the cultists\u2019 exploration.<br><br>The guards are dead, having been dragged off and eaten by trolls living in the tunnels beneath the well. Those sewers remain largely intact, and the 3 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGQwNDJlYTRjMDBh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>trolls</a> </strong>that dwell there have discovered that using them to move between the crypt and the plaza makes for good foraging in the area. If the party rests here or in area 5, the trolls attack in the night. A troll fights until reduced to one-third or fewer of its hit points before retreating to the safety of the well.<br><br>The entrance to the tunnels is too narrow for even a Small character to squeeze through. The trolls dislocate their hips and shoulders to pass through, taking 10 bludgeoning damage that they quickly regenerate.<br><br><h4>Approaching the Statues</h4>When the party approaches the statues, read the following.<br><br><blockquote>As you approach the statues, you hear the sudden sound of grinding stone. The colossal figures turn their massive heads, their shattered features staring down at you. Two voices issue forth in unison, booming out as though erupting from the deep earth.<br><br>\u201cHalt. You come before Diderius, ether walker and conduit of clairvoyance. Behold ye now his wondrous triumphs. Diderius extends wisdom, and Diderius offers knowledge. Which do you seek?\u201d</blockquote><br>If a response of \u201cWe seek wisdom,\u201d or \u201cWe desire knowledge\u201d is given, or the characters roleplay an obsequious or self-deprecating response that might please an egotistical wizard, the statues respond. They say, \u201cDiderius shall grant you what you seek, but only if you heed him and continue to show proper respect!\u201d They then revert to their original positions.<br><br>The adventurers\u2019 positive response earns them beneficial warnings, courtesy of the magic of Diderius. Warnings are detailed in the areas to which they apply.<br><br>Any response other than \u201cknowledge\u201d or \u201cwisdom\u201d that is not in some way flattering to Diderius\u2014including questions for clarification\u2014results in the statues reverting to their initial positions. The characters are free to continue on into the complex, but they receive no benefit from this interaction.<br><hr><h3>2. Antechamber</h3>While an illusion still shows a tomb with gilded carvings and silver censers, these are mere shadows. Looters have defaced and ruined the relief-carved walls, and the censers are long gone. Set between the carvings are a dozen alcoves recognizable as funerary niches, though these contain only splinters of bone. At the far end of the chamber, a stone door hangs ajar. Marks on the door and frame indicate that it was recently forced.<hr><h3>3. Watchful Statues</h3>Six statues stand here, all of cowled wizards leaning on staffs, their faces obscured by deep hoods. The hollows the hoods form are particularly dark. Niches between the statues once held skeletal guardians that fought the cultists. The bones of more than a dozen humanoids now litter the ground.<br><br>Characters who chose well when speaking with the statues in area 1 are struck by a sudden thought when they enter this area: \u201cSome secrets are not meant for mortal minds to know. Look away from the darkness in which such knowledge hides.\u201d<br><br><strong><em>Statue Trap</em></strong>. When the first adventurer passes the halfway point of the room, the sound of grinding stone announces the statues turning their cowled heads to follow the characters\u2019 movements. The characters must not look into the darkness in the statues\u2019 hoods. Any character who does must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw against a <em>suggestion </em>spell. Success indicates that the character shrugs off the statue\u2019s magic, while failure indicates the character is held by the dark gaze within the stony cowl for 1 round. During this time, the statue whispers impossible secrets to the character, which carry both benefit and burden.<br><br>The character must then make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the character cannot grasp the secrets it was shown, and there is no effect. On a success, the character understands the world more accurately, gaining advantage on Intelligence checks for the next 24 hours. However, the character is also driven temporarily insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can\u2019t take actions or reactions, can\u2019t understand what other creatures say, can\u2019t read, and speaks only in gibberish. You control the creature\u2019s movement, which is erratic.<hr><h3>4. Mosaic Chamber</h3>This chamber is a high vaulted dome with a deep inset ledge circling the room, 10 feet wide and 15 feet up. The floor here is set with a beautiful tile mosaic showing a knight in plate armor wielding a glowing sword against a chimera. The word \u201cSAFE\u201d is written in chalk on the door leading to area 5, marking that chamber as a resting place used by the cultists.<br><br>When the first character enters this room, the<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWVlMjA4ZjliM2Mx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>tile chimera</a></strong> begins to slowly shift. With a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character notices this movement and is not surprised as the tiles shoot up and the chimera seemingly claws its way out of the mosaic. <br><br>The tile chimera acts as a normal <strong>chimera </strong>magically animated and customized per the handout <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTY3YTA1NGJlZWI5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Customization: Animated Tile Creature</a>. It makes a clacking noise as it moves, and when injured, it sprays tiles instead of bleeding. It is thin in one dimension and can use that fact to its advantage in combat. The creature flies up to the ledge to use its fire breath at range, flying down to attack in melee until it can breathe again. <br><br><strong><em>Mosaic Sun</em></strong>. The sun is depicted in the mosaic near the hallway that is area 6\u2014and is actually a sliding circular plate that reveals the bone boulder trap in that area. The plate is only apparent with a successful DC 24 Wisdom (Perception) check or a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check. <br><br><strong><em>Door Hazard</em></strong>. The double doors leading to area 12 are plated in corroded copper engraved to depict a group of wizards peering over a pool of water. The oversized figure of a male wizard at the top of the image raises his hands as if summoning a creature from the pool.<br><br>The doors bulge out noticeably from their frame, pushed out by the weight of stone where the ceiling of the corridor between area 4 and area 12 has collapsed. Pulling on either door unleashes enough force to break the hinges and send the doors and a wall of rubble crashing into the room. Any creature within 10 feet of the doors must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw to jump out of the way. On a failure, the creature takes 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage, or half damage on a successful save. The fall of rubble leaves the hallway filled with stone and impassable. <hr><h3>5. Well Chamber</h3>The divination pool used water to create a mirror-like surface for its powerful rituals, which was replenished from this well. The well holds water still, but the regional effects Diderius imposes on his lair causes it to evaporate within a few rounds of being hauled up into this area. A bronze bucket on a rope sits near the well, while an empty basin stands 8 feet up along the north wall, with stone steps leading up to it. A brass lever protrudes from the wall near the basin. When water is poured into the basin and the lever pulled, it feeds the sluice in area 12.<br><br>The sides of the well and the floor next to it are covered in bright red mushrooms. They are slick with a watery sheen that resembles blood, and have the taste and texture of raw liver if picked and eaten before the lair effects spoil them. They are safe to consume, however.<br><br>The cultists used this room as a forward campsite during their short expedition. Sleeping rolls and camping gear are scattered around. As with the door leading into this area, \u201cSAFE\u201d is scribed on the wall in chalk in case anyone became lost or disoriented. <br><br><strong>Trolls</strong>. The well here connects to the reservoir that feeds the fountain in the plaza outside. The trolls in that area sometimes come here when their hunting goes poorly and feed on the liver mushrooms. Though the cultists did not encounter them before being taken by the yuan-ti, the trolls attack in the middle of the night if the party uses this area for resting. As on the plaza, the trolls flee down the well if badly injured.<hr><h3>6. Hallway</h3>This hallway slants down sharply, dropping 15 feet over its full length. Any character who takes a moment to poke around and succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices a secret panel halfway down the hallway, large enough for a Small creature to fit through, or a Medium creature that is squeezing. The panel reveals a narrow shaft that once housed a dumbwaiter, which drops down 30 feet to the stairwell leading to area 11. (The cultists discovered this shaft and used it to enter areas 10 and 11, though no sign can be found of their passage.)<br><br><strong><em>Bone Boulder Trap</em></strong>. At 15 feet beyond the shaft entrance, a mechanical plate installed in the floor triggers a rolling boulder trap. A successful DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) check by one of the characters in the first rank of the marching order is required to notice this trigger without activating the pressure plate. <br><br>If the plate is activated, the circular mosaic pattern that appears as the sun on the floor in area 4 slides back and a 7-foot-diameter sphere made of hundreds of skeletal bodies rises magically from the floor. This bone boulder tilts toward area 6 and rolls down the sloping hallway before crashing against the wall in area 7. <br><br>As it rolls through, the bone boulder crushes and slashes at any creature in area 6, dealing 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage and 18 (4d8) slashing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. Any creature that fails this first save is grabbed by skeletal hands and pulled into the sphere, which continues to roll over any other creatures in the hallway.<br><br>A creature trapped in the bone boulder can attempt a DC 17 Strength or Dexterity check to break free before the boulder slams into the wall in area 7. Any creature that fails to escape is inside the boulder when it hits, and is caught in an explosion of bones and stone, taking 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and 14 (4d6) slashing damage.<hr><h3>7. Throne Room Antechamber</h3>The smell of incense fills this room, and rich tapestries cover the walls. On the south wall, a chute large enough only for a Small character to squeeze through lets in light from outside. <br><br>If the characters spoke properly to the statues in area 1, an unfamiliar voice is heard to whisper as they enter this area: \u201cHumility proffered in the manner of Mystril shelters those opening the way to seeking knowledge.\u201d A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check reminds a character of a holy gesture among adherents of the fallen goddess Mystril, involving turning the head downward and raising the hands as if holding a lamp. Characters who make this gesture while opening the double doors to the north can pass without difficulty.<br><br><strong><em>Sarcophagi</em></strong>. Six sarcophagi are embedded in the walls behind the tapestries, holding the mummified remains of Diderius\u2019s household guards. A character who opens the north double doors without making the proper gesture, or who tampers with a sarcophagus, awakens the 6 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGM4MDlmNmNkZmY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mummies</a></strong>, which lurch forth and attack.<hr><h3>8. Throne Room</h3>A throne on a massive dais resembles a floating cloud concealing a golden sun. Seated on the throne is a twelve-foot-tall, regal and well-muscled humanoid male with a flowing white beard and purple toga\u2014in reality, a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjYwYzQ2MzlmM2Jh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>clay golem</a></strong> that Diderius used to receive favored guests in this area. The unnatural appearance of the throne and the golem are the result of a <em>permanent image</em> spell. At the foot of the throne is a pile of treasure containing 250 sp, six fine silver necklaces worth 50 gp each, and a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDYwNWEwMWI2NDA4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>potion of fire breath</a></em>. Even with a quick glance, characters can see that the pile also contains hundreds of copper pieces and worthless bits of jewelry and pottery.<br><br>In addition to the illusion covering it, the golem has been imbued with castings of <em>magic mouth</em>. When any character first approaches it, the creature speaks in a soothing, magnificent voice, saying, \u201cYe who seek Diderius\u2019s insight must first furnish tribute, that Diderius might work his mighty magic. Lay such tribute at my feet or depart.\u201d<br><br>Diderius was not a greedy wizard, and he accepted even meek offerings from the poor in the town. As long as each party member places something more valuable than a clay cup in the treasure pile, the characters are allowed to pass. If the adventurers attempt to steal any of the treasure or to use the door to area 10 without leaving treasure, the golem attacks. <hr><h3>9. Study and Library</h3>The room east of the throne room antechamber was Diderius\u2019s study and library, in which he would meet with sages and travelers. Its dusty shelves and tables are now empty, the scrolls and tomes once held here having been looted long ago. However, the area\u2019s unwitting guardian remains. <br><br>Ilda is a neutral good <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OTJmMTg1ZjU0ZTFi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>ghost </a>who was once one of Diderius\u2019s apprentices. She worshiped her master, but was mistakenly banished as a thief when one of his prize tomes was misplaced. Ilda died not long after Diderius, and her spirit returned here to act as caretaker to his great stores of knowledge.<br><br>Ilda is not violent except to those who would steal from Diderius. She manifests when the characters enter this area, demanding to know why they have come and threatening them if they plan to loot the library. If the characters point out that there\u2019s nothing left in the library to steal, Ilda is overcome by a fit of misery as she agonizes over her failures. A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Religion) check reveals that Ilda can be released from her sojourn here if any volumes from the lost library are returned (see area 11).<br><br>Ilda knows that yuan-ti dwell in the innermost parts of the complex. She knows nothing about the cultists, who have not entered this area. If the characters gain her confidence, she can also offer up the following information: <br><br><ul><li>Diderius\u2019s passion was powerful divination magic, which is how he discovered the mysterious pool in this cavern complex. He excavated these chambers around the pool, and kings and wizards came bearing tribute. When he died after many centuries of life, this underground manse became his crypt.</li><li>The divination pool allows those using it to peer past many magical protections that block lesser divination magic.</li><li>The pool\u2019s revelations could drive a user insane unless the questions asked were specific and dealt only with the physical world, avoiding metaphysical concerns. Gazing into the pool without first offering a sacrifice was exceedingly dangerous.</li><li>Using the divination pool required a personal sacrifice, but over time, the pool\u2019s demands grew steeper. If others have been using the pool since Diderius died, as Ilda suspects the yuan-ti do, its current price must be dark indeed.</li></ul><br><h4>Ghostly Roleplaying</h4>Even a confrontation with a good ghost should be harrowing. This is a creature whose spirit is tied to the world out of anguish, and any interaction with Ilda should be a precarious process of talking to a character who might fly off the handle at any moment. She might vanish into thin air for no reason, then return in a fury if the characters try to call her back.<hr><h3>10. Dining Hall</h3>Two long tables of plain stone stand at the south end of this dining hall, while a long marble table stands to the north. The door up the stairs leading to area 8 has \u201c? DANGER\u201d written in chalk on it. The door down the southern stairs is spiked shut, and has \u201cDANGER\u201d scrawled on it in chalk.<br><br>Five<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjViNzY4ZWNiMmEz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>bearded devils</a></strong> are seated at the marble table\u2014the last survivors of Varram\u2019s expedition. When his cultist followers were routed investigating area 11, Varram left the devils here with instructions to guard against any creatures coming out of that area. The devils take their orders seriously, which means they all but ignore the adventurers unless the characters attack.<br><br>If the devils are questioned politely, they tell the characters only that they were ordered to remain here. They admit that their master is Varram, and speak of great treasure down the stairs to the south. The dwarf has been gone for some time, but they have no idea what happened to him.<br><br>If the devils are offered 100 gp or more in gems, they also tell the characters that they have fought and killed undead in the complex; that the dwarf lost something important to his cult and needs the divination pool to get it back; and that they are working for the cult on the orders of their lord Zariel, Archduchess of Avernus, who wants Tiamat out of the Nine Hells.<br><br>The characters are free to pass through this room, including entering area 11\u2014but they will be attacked with glee by the devils when they leave that area.<hr><h3>11. Treasure Vault</h3>While Diderius lived, this area was his bedchamber, and it still contains an elegant bed, sets of bookshelves, a large wooden chest, and a side table set with ewer and goblets. The cultists sealed this room after a disastrous run-in with its undead guardians.<br><br><strong><em>On the Stairs</em></strong>. The dumbwaiter shaft from area 6 to the stairwell in front of the vault was once used to bypass the long walk from the bedchamber to the upper parts of the complex for Diderius\u2019s servants. The dumbwaiter\u2019s ropes and rotted wooden platform are strewn across the stairs.<br><br>This area is guarded by 2 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTdiMTQ3NWFhYTg0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wraiths</a> </strong>and 4 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGI1YmQxZDNlODRk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>specters</a></strong>. The wraiths are the spirits of warriors who pledged their souls to Diderius in exchange for the wizard\u2019s exotic knowledge. They can be defeated in combat, but their spirits are bound to the room by ancient magic, causing them to manifest again 24 hours after being destroyed. The specters are the reanimated souls of three cultists who died here and of three yuan-ti that died exploring the ruins. They do not manifest again if destroyed.<br><br>A successful DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals a loose brick in the wall opposite the door. Pulling the brick out reveals magic runes carved into the wall that bind the wraiths that guard this area. Marring the runes prevents the wraiths from manifesting again if they are destroyed.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The bookshelves contain magical treatises and notes on divination that have withstood the ravages of time. They detail the spellcasting practices of ancient Netheril, and will fetch 750 gp if sold. If the characters search the room, they find a crumbling book titled <em>Transubstantiality across Potentialities </em>stuck between the bed and the wall. If it is returned to the library (area 9), the ghost is free to move on from this world.<br><br>The silver ewer and four goblets next to the bed are magical. If a character pours from the empty ewer into an empty goblet, a fuming gas flows between both vessels. A character who \u201cdrinks\u201d from a gas-filled goblet receives advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance to poison damage for 3 hours. Each of the goblets can be used to produce this effect once per seven days.<br><br>The airtight chest holds seven silk robes kept free from rot, and worth 50 gp each if sold.<br><br>The chest also holds an amethyst-set <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YjM4MmQxYjEyNWM2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>ring of poison resistance</a></em> and two scrolls of <em>protection from energy</em>.<hr><h3>12. Divination Pool</h3>This long gallery holds the magic pool that was the source of Diderius\u2019s power. The double doors to the south have no markings on them, but they feature the same hazard as the doors in area 4. <br><br>Broken arrows, bloodstains, and a dead cultist are strewn across the floor of the chamber. A DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that the arrows were shot from the north doorway leading into area 13. The arrows are carved of stone and their heads are in the shape of fangs, set with the symbol of a cobra with a crown above it. A DC 18 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes the symbol of the yuan-ti god Merrshaulk.<br><br>If a character inspects the body, it is revealed that the cultist died not from arrows but from a dagger wound. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that a <em>dragontooth dagger </em>was the killing weapon. This was the unlucky cultist the duplicitous Varram sacrificed when he used the pool.<br><br><strong><em>The Pool</em></strong>. The pool is currently empty. Varram had only just completed the pool\u2019s divination ritual when the yuan-ti attacked and hauled him off. A stone sluice runs from the southern wall to empty into the pool. If the characters can fill the basin in area 5 and release the sluice quickly enough, the water pours into the pool before it has a chance to evaporate. Alternatively, the pool can be activated with a flask of holy water, which is not subject to the mummy lord\u2019s lair effects.<br><br>When any water hits the pool, it spreads out and flares with a black light. Any character who received Ilda\u2019s warning (or who remembers the statues in area 3) will hopefully declare that he or she looks away from the pool. Otherwise, a character must make a DC 20 saving throw against a <em>suggestion </em>spell. On a failed save, the character gazes into the divination pool unless another character immediately pulls the curious victim away from the pool (and avoids gazing into it as he or she does so). If not pulled away, a gazing character is driven temporarily insane for 1 minute (see area 3). A character pulled away from the pool does not suffer insanity but is stunned for 1 minute. <br><br><h4>Using the Pool</h4>The divination pool has always required that a user make a personal sacrifice to gain its secrets. However, the pool\u2019s magic has grown considerably hungrier over the long years of its isolation. In response to the cruelty of the yuan-ti, using the pool requires the sacrifice of all or a significant part of a sentient creature.<hr><h3>13. Crypt of Diderius</h3>Diderius\u2019s final resting place is a 20-foot-high chamber lit by braziers imbued with <em>continual flame</em>. A massive stone sarcophagus sits atop a stepped stone dais at center. The walls are decorated with life-sized frescoes showing the lost gods of Netheril and Anauria. If the party benefits from the boon granted in area 1, all the characters sense it would be disrespectful to disturb anything here\u2014everything should remain as it is.<br><br><strong><em>Frescoes</em></strong>. Characters who examine the frescoes can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discover thin plaster on four of them. If any such fresco is broken open, a<strong> </strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGM4MDlmNmNkZmY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mummy</a> hidden behind it attacks. The other three hidden mummies, all once Diderius\u2019s advisers, smash free to attack thereafter.<br><br><strong><em>Sarcophagus</em></strong>. <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTc2YjE4NzI2MDhl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Diderius</a>, the <strong>mummy lord</strong>, rests within the sarcophagus. When the characters approach within a few paces of it, a deep, clear voice issues from the coffin, saying, \u201cYou approach Diderius in repose. I know what you seek.\u201d <br><br>If the adventurers spoke well to the staues in area 1, the voice says, \u201cYuan-ti have taken the one called Varram beyond their portal in the northern wall. Be prepared, for I shall open the way to peril.\u201d Unless the characters ask Diderius to wait, a moment later, with a chiming sound, the secret door opens to area 14. The party gains a surprise round to act against the guards there.<br><br>Those who didn\u2019t speak well in area 1 must ask Diderius about Varram to gain information about his whereabouts. Failure to do so respectfully causes Diderius to say, \u201cLeave me to my rest or face your doom.\u201d Diderius opens the way only for those who are particularly decorous in this exchange.<br><br>If the adventurers try to open the sarcophagus, Diderius warns them. If they persist, he attacks. The mummies behind the frescoes also smash free and attack. None of the monsters pursue those who flee this room, which soon returns to its original state.<br><br>A canopic jar in the sarcophagus contains Diderius\u2019s withered heart.<br><br><strong><em>Secret Door.</em></strong> In the northern wall is a secret door (Intelligence [Investigation] DC 20 to find). Knocking on the stone wall reveals a hollow echo beyond, but the mechanism for opening the door is on the other side. A <em>knock </em>or <em>stone shape</em> spell can open it, or the door can be forced with a successful DC 20 Strength check.<br></section>", "img": "modules/mod-rise-of-tiamat/journal/003_-_Episode_3_3A_Death_to_the_Wyrmspeakers_-_Varram_the_White/002_-_Tomb_of_Diderius/avatar.png"}

A small group of yuan-ti now lives here, backed up by lizardfolk slaves. They are the caretakers of the divination pool, which high-ranking yuan-ti use to seek magical insight for their far-reaching plots. The yuan-ti have avoided moving into the original chambers of the complex, fearing the undead there. Instead, they have expanded the complex by excavating deeper into the cliff side.<br><br>The yuan-ti capture and sacrifice those who visit the tomb of Diderius. They are not above cutting a deal to save themselves, however. <hr><h3>General Features</h3>It is noticeably warmer here than in the crypt, and the air is uncomfortably humid throughout.<br><br><strong><em>Walls</em></strong>. The walls of the yuan-ti enclave are worked slabs of dark green stone, slick with slime and moisture.<br><br><strong><em>Ceiling</em></strong>. 10 feet high unless otherwise indicated.<br><br><strong><em>Light</em></strong>. None unless otherwise indicated.<hr><h3>14. Entryway</h3>This rough natural cavern holds the winch system for raising the stone slab secret door between area 13 and area 14. The doorway is guarded by 6 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjRiNWE4Y2QxYTVk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>lizardfolk</a></strong>, which attack at the first sign of the door rising between this area and area 13. One lizardfolk runs to warn the yuan-ti while the others move into position near the door.<br><br>If it takes the characters more than 10 rounds to open the door, 4 more <strong></strong><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjRiNWE4Y2QxYTVk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>lizardfolk</a></strong><strong> </strong>and 3 <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmUzZGM1ZmRjY2Nk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i><strong>yuan-ti malisons</strong></a><strong> </strong>(type 1) show up. The door is then opened from this area and the enemy forces attack. The malisons retreat if one of them is killed. The lizardfolk retreat when half of them are dead.<br><br>The eastern stairs descend 30 feet before coming to the bridge in area 15.<hr><h3>15. Bridge</h3>The steep stairs from area 14 lead to an uneven stone bridge extending over a dark pit. The bridge slopes downward 40 feet to another stairwell leading down.<br><br>Moisture drips down from the high ceiling, covering the bridge in slick moss that hangs over the edge in green cascades. Any creature moving along of the bridge must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or fall. On a failed saving throw, a creature can attempt a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to cling to the bridge rather than fall off into the darkness.<br><br>The pit over which the bridge extends is 120 feet deep at the top of the bridge (to the west) and 80 feet deep at the foot of the bridge (to the east). The area below the bridge is a feeding chamber for the snakelike yuan-ti young (see area 19), which crawl between the two areas through holes in the wall. Any characters or lizardfolk that fall off the bridge take appropriate falling damage, then are attacked by the yuan-ti young. Climbing back up to where the bridge meets either set of stairs requires three successful DC 15 Athletics checks.<br><br>Any lizardfolk that retreated from area 14 attempt to hold the party off here. In addition, 6 more <strong><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjRiNWE4Y2QxYTVk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>lizardfolk</a> </strong></strong>crouch on the bridge to reinforce the area, hoping that characters trying to fight their way past fall off into the darkness below. They are supported by 2 <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmUzZGM1ZmRjY2Nk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>yuan-ti malisons</a> (type 1) armed with bows, which attack from the eastern stairs. The malisons also use <em>suggestion </em>spells to tell characters that a fellow party member has been replaced by a yuan-ti spy and should be attacked.<hr><h3>16. Meditation Chamber</h3>In this large chamber, the yuan-ti meditate in the name of their dark gods and discuss their own plans and schemes. The northeast and southwest walls of this chamber feature statue shrines to the yuan-ti deities Merrshaulk and Sseth. The other two walls have statues of yuan-ti high priests carved into them, with suits of plate armor arranged as offerings at their feet.<br><br>When the characters arrive here, hundreds of snakes begin to slither out of holes in the statues and the corners of the room. Though they are not a threat by themselves, the snakes fill the suits of armor, which rise up to attack as 2<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NmFkYmYwMDZmZTZm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>snake horrors</a></strong>. The horrors won\u2019t leave this room.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Four rubies worth 1,000 gold pieces each are set in the eyes of the statues and can be pried out.<hr><h3>17. Yuan-ti Quarters</h3>A dozen cylindrical shafts 3 feet wide and 7 feet deep are cut into the stone floor here, and are used as sleeping holes by the lesser yuan-ti. Two totems stand here, both in the form of asps rising up with their mouths open. These totems radiate magic that negates some of the regional effects of a mummy lord\u2019s lair in this area, allowing the yuan-ti to store food and water here that does not evaporate or spoil.<br><br>This room is presently guarded by 3 <strong><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjRiNWE4Y2QxYTVk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>lizardfolk</a> </strong></strong>and 1 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Yjg4ZjY5MWY0OTVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>yuan-ti pureblood</a></strong>, unless those creatures have already been encountered in area 18.<br><br><strong><em>Dart Trap</em></strong>. The secret door in the hallway leading to area 21 is marked by an archway scribed into the wall. However, a pressure plate is set 10 feet before the archway, revealed by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. When any creature steps on the pressure plate, darts shoot out from the walls along the length of the hallway, targeting all creatures in the area: +8 to hit, 3 (1d6) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage and be paralyzed for 1 minute.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Characters who search the sleeping holes can find 600 copper pieces, 200 silver pieces, and 150 gold pieces, as well as a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2VjZjMyYmM2ZDE5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>potion of poison</a></em>.<hr><h3>18. Long Hallway</h3>The walls of this long hallway seem to undulate, moving back and forth as though the corridor is slithering in the manner of a giant snake. This is only a <em>permanent illusion</em> effect, but it is unsettling all the same.<br><br>When the characters reach the turn in the hallway, 4 <strong><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjRiNWE4Y2QxYTVk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>lizardfolk</a> </strong></strong>charge from the direction of area 22, followed by 2 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MmUzZGM1ZmRjY2Nk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>yuan-ti malisons</a> </strong>(type 1). If the characters moved past the door to area 17 without checking that room, the 3 <strong><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjRiNWE4Y2QxYTVk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>lizardfolk</a> </strong></strong>and 1<strong> <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Yjg4ZjY5MWY0OTVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>yuan-ti purebloods</a></strong> </strong>in that area come charging out.<hr><h3>19. Hatchery</h3>The floor of this room is 20 feet below the floor of the adjoining hallways, which are reached by tall ladders. The walls of this yuan-ti hatchery drip with slime, and the floor literally writhes with the room\u2019s occupants. Yuan-ti produce copious young, which are consumed by their siblings so that only the strongest survive. A swarm of these young (use the a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjRkMzZmYmZlMjM3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>swarm of poisonous snakes</a></strong>) crawl through piles of eggs and crushed egg shells littering the floor, and are watched over by 1<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjVjNTM0N2Q4ODNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>yuan-ti abomination</a> </strong>and 3 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Yjg4ZjY5MWY0OTVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>yuan-ti purebloods</a></strong>. <br><br>At the first sign of the party, the yuan-ti use <em>suggestion </em>as they apologize for any previous strife, stating that their kin meant no harm to the characters. As a show of good faith, the abomination invites the characters to descend the ladders and join the yuan-ti for a feast.<br><br>If the characters are completely swayed, the yuan-ti wait until they descend, then they and the swarms attack. If the characters flee, the yuan-ti pursue. If they are attacked from above, the yuan-ti ascend the ladders to fight. The abomination flees any fight if reduced to half its hit points or fewer.<hr><h3>20. Lizardfolk Den</h3>This foul-smelling chamber is piled high with trash and filth. The yuan-ti\u2019s lizardfolk slaves are kept here. The area is presently empty, with all its residents accounted for in other areas. <br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Hidden throughout the lizardfolk\u2019s filthy nests are 22 gold pieces and 125 silver pieces in loose coin.<hr><h3>21. Prison</h3>The yuan-ti use humanoid sacrifice to power the magic of the divination pool. Their unfortunate victims are held here until needed, but the prison is presently empty. <hr><h3>22. Temple</h3>The heart of the yuan-ti settlement, this huge chamber features giant stone serpents along the east and west walls, their open mouths guttering green flames. The leaders of the yuan-ti are here\u20143<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=Yjg4ZjY5MWY0OTVm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>yuan-ti purebloods</a></strong>, 2<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTE5YjExOTA0NTZl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>yuan-ti malisons</a></strong> (type 2), and 1<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjVjNTM0N2Q4ODNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>yuan-ti abomination</a></strong> priestess\u2014along with any yuan-ti and lizardfolk that retreated from previous encounters. <br><br>The yuan-ti and lizardfolk stand in the shadows of the flickering green flames, ready to attack but understanding that the adventurers are a serious threat if they\u2019ve made it this far unscathed. At the back of the room, near an altar carved with the form of a giant openmouthed cobra, the comatose Varram has been beaten and bound. <br><br><h4>Dealing for the Dwarf</h4>If the characters have made any mention of their search for Varram during their previous battles with the yuan-ti or lizardfolk, the yuan-ti abomination priestess holds Varram\u2019s <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTI2ZDViOTYzYzU0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>dragontooth dagger</a></em> to the dwarf\u2019s neck. The priestess has heard of the characters\u2019 mission, though she does not know or care why they seek the dwarf.<br><br>If the yuan-ti have no idea why the characters have attacked, the priestess knows only that Varram has been begging for his life by promising the yuan-ti great wealth if he is freed. The priestess plans to bargain with the characters by offering them the hypothetical wealth the dwarf has promised her.<br><br>Either way, if the characters want <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGQ5NjU0MjAwZjli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Varram</a> alive, the priestess demands that the party leave the complex without killing any more yuan-ti. She is willing to turn over the dwarf, but explains that his soul has been temporarily drawn from his body by powerful yuan-ti magic. When the characters have left the enclave, it will be returned. (The priestess is lying\u2014Varram is in his present semiconscious state because of the brutal treatment he\u2019s received at the hands of the yuan-ti.)<br><br>If the characters refuse her offer, the priestess attempts to use <em>suggestion </em>to sway whomever she perceives as the party\u2019s leader. If that fails and combat breaks out, she slays Varram (he has only 3 hit points remaining), then attacks with her followers. <br><br><h4>Developments</h4>A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals a secret space and a passage beneath one of the serpent statues in the temple. Within the space is the enclave\u2019s treasure hoard, comprising 800 gold pieces, 100 platinum pieces, 2 cloudy emeralds worth 500 gp each, a necklace of 22 crysoprase beads worth 20 gp each, and 2 scrolls, one of <em>levitation </em>and the other of <em>call lightning</em>. The passage leads to the exit the yuan-ti use to leave the complex without passing through the crypt. The exit is carefully hidden behind a screen of rocks and scrub trees a hundred yards away from the plaza entrance to the ruins.<br></section>", "img": "modules/mod-rise-of-tiamat/journal/003_-_Episode_3_3A_Death_to_the_Wyrmspeakers_-_Varram_the_White/003_-_Ss_27tck_27al/avatar.png"}

To compensate, the cultists launched several raids against the elves of the Misty Forest, led by Wyrmspeaker <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTY5YjAwZmZlZTI5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Neronvain</a> and his companion, the green dragon Chuth. <br><br>Having fulfilled their quota for the cult, wyrmspeaker and dragon retreated deeper into the Misty Forest, leaving the elven enclaves ruined behind them. However, the survivors of those cult raids would have been astonished to learn that the green wyrmspeaker is Neronvain\u2014King Melandrach\u2019s exiled son, believed to have died many years before. <br><br>On one of his raids, Neronvain won the fealty of an elf named Galin\u2014a warden of the forest who pledged his service to the wyrmspeaker in exchange for ending the attack on his home village. Neronvain accepted, using Galin\u2019s knowledge of the Misty Forest to help plan raids against other settlements. Galin has so far kept secret his oath to Neronvain, though he feels tremendous guilt over his actions.<br><br>Under King Melandrach\u2019s command, the elves of the Misty Forest have stepped up their defenses, and the cult attacks have ceased. Melandrach believes the threat has ended, though his son Alagarthas disagrees. Prince Alagarthas used the Emerald Enclave to search for clues to the source of the raids, and they have learned that an elf seen with the green dragon appeared to command the beast. Both Prince Alagarthas and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDk1NTRkMDg1MjQ2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Delaan Winterhound</a> of the Emerald Enclave believe that more attacks are imminent, and that the green dragon\u2019s master might be one of the cult\u2019s wyrmspeakers.

Enormous spruce trees dominate the northern end of the forest where Altand is found\u2014and where Neronvain and Chuth have established their stronghold.<hr><h3>General Features</h3><strong><em>Mist.</em></strong> The mist in the forest is omnipresent. Though it can be ignored inside buildings, all outdoor areas of the forest are lightly obscured. <hr><h3>Investigation at Altand</h3>Altand is primarily a wood elf settlement, blending almost seamlessly into the forest around it. The village exists on two levels, with a few structures built on the ground around an ancient monument to an elven ranger. Residences and the village temple are built into the upper boughs of the forest. The elves string rope bridges between these sites and construct circular walkways around the trees. <br><br>Like many other settlements raided by the dragon, pulley-operated platforms connect the two levels of the village, and provide an excellent defense against the orcs that occasionally enter the forest as an alternative to raiding human settlements along the Trade Way. However, those defenses proved a deathtrap against the flying green dragon, leaving many elves unable to reach the ground quickly enough to escape. <br><hr><h3>Survivors\u2019 Tales</h3>Of the three hundred residents of the village, more than half survived the raid\u2014a different outcome than at other raided settlements, where the dragon hunted and killed the elves to the last adult and child. Many of the residents of Altand were on the ground when the attack came. Of the elves in the upper level of the village, many died of the dragon\u2019s poisonous breath while waiting to descend, or fell to their deaths as bridges and walkways collapsed under the weight of panic.<br><br>Most survivors fled and saw little of what ensued. However, by asking careful questions of a number of villagers, the characters can learn the following:<br><ul><li>The dragon swooped down and attacked on the ground first. Nearly half of the village\u2019s victims died during that first assault.</li><li>Humans in the regalia of the Cult of the Dragon followed the dragon, killing all those they found. The village\u2019s priest stepped out to lead others in fighting the dragon, but the beast swallowed him whole.</li><li>Some survivors claim to have seen a cultist riding atop the dragon. Most of those refer to the dragon rider as human, like the other cultists. However, a few people report that the figure moved with the grace of an elf.</li><li>With the priest dead, the village\u2019s warden, Galin, has become the leader of Altand. Though he was in the thick of the fight, he survived unscathed, and has been a potent force for rallying the survivors.</li><li>The attack lasted only a short while, then the dragon unexpectedly retreated. The cultists followed, but as they fled, they took nothing of value from the village. This is a stark contrast to the dragon\u2019s other raids, which were focused on capturing treasure.</li></ul><hr><h3>The Warden\u2019s Story</h3>Galin the warden is a nervous-looking elf with a dark secret. The folk of the village describe him as suffering from the weight of his new leadership role and the deaths of more than a hundred villagers\u2014including his own wife.<br><br>In response to any question about Galin, the characters are directed to his residence in the upper boughs of the village.<br><br><blockquote>Stepping into a modest dwelling suspended among iron-strong boughs, you enter a cozy sitting room. A slim elf sits at a desk, standing to greet you with a forced smile as a raven perched in a nearby cage caws hideously.<br><br>\u201cWelcome to our village,\u201d the elf says. \u201cHow can I be of service?\u201d</blockquote><br>Galin answers any questions the characters put to him, but his responses echo only what the other survivors know. He claims to have not seen the dragon rider and disbelieves those who say they did, dismissing such reports as the result of fear and chaos during the raid. A successful DC 18 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that the elf warden is withholding information. If he is pressed on this, he admits that he saw the dragon kill his wife and is wracked by guilt that he could not save her. A follow-up successful DC 16 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that even this isn\u2019t the whole truth, but Galin takes umbrage if the character ply him with any more questions.<br><hr><h3>Silent Witnesses</h3>Where the humanoid witnesses to the attack are limited in their knowledge, the characters have other potential resources to draw on. By using <em>speak with plants</em>, the characters can draw on the impressions and memories of the trees themselves. Though the spell allows only for impressions of the previous 24 hours to be recalled by its subjects, the trees of Altand can report that late the previous night, they witnessed Galin sneaking out of the village and disappearing into the woods, accompanied by his pet raven. Galin has been making this sojourn most nights since the attack, giving Neronvain information on other elven settlements, which the wyrmspeaker is using to plan his next round of assaults.<br><br>If the characters use <em>speak with animals</em> to question the raven, they learn that Galin walked a mile or more into the woods and came face to face with the green dragon Chuth and his rider the previous night. Remember that an animal intelligence is not as articulate as a humanoid, and it might take subtle coaxing to get the raven to describe a scene that likely frightened it.<br><br>The characters might also choose to watch and follow Galin on one of his late night excursions. Neronvain does not show up that night, but the warden\u2019s prearranged meeting place is a spot of flattened brush where a dragon has clearly landed more than once.<br><hr><h3>Confronting Galin </h3>If confronted with evidence against him gained by spellcraft or subterfuge, Galin accuses the adventurers (publicly if necessary) of being in league with the cult and attempting to break the resolve of Altand\u2019s survivors. If the characters have access to <em>zone of truth</em> or similar magic, he flatly refuses to take part in any further questioning. <br><br>Galin will not respond to intimidation. However, effective roleplaying can be used to tap into his guilt. If he is offered commiseration for his wife\u2019s death\u2014as opposed to accusations\u2014the warden eventually breaks down. He confesses that after seeing his wife killed, he found himself face to face with Neronvain in the thick of battle and begged for his life, offering anything in return. Neronvain took the warden up on his offer, agreeing to spare Galin and leave Altand intact in exchange for information on other settlements that would become the targets of the cult\u2019s next round of raids.<br><br>Galin does not know the identity of the green wyrmspeaker, or the location of Neronvain and Chuth\u2019s lair. However, from the meeting place, he has watched<br>the dragon flying off on a course due southeast and he has noticed that the wyrmspeaker\u2019s clothes and hair are often wet.<br><hr id=\"userscript-horizontalrule\"><h3>Into the Forest</h3>Neronvain\u2019s stronghold lies thirty miles from Altand through dense, fog-filled forest. As they seek the wyrmspeaker and his dragon, the characters meet an old druid who can help or hinder their quest, and must deal with the spidery guardians Chuth has set outside his lair.<br><br><h4>A Timely Rescue</h4>As the characters travel through the forest, they hear the crunch of a large tree breaking, followed by a female voice crying out. If they investigate, they see a venerable woman with her leg trapped under a heavy fallen tree. She calls out for help when she sees the party. This <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzE2OGQ0NTI1MzVh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>druid</a></strong> is the caretaker of this part of the forest. <br><br>Three <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NjJkYWEwZmJlODY1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>awakened trees</a></strong> are hidden among the other trees nearby\u2014one of which has intentionally and harmlessly fallen across the druid, allowing her to feign injury and draw the characters to her. She guesses correctly that the group are seeking the dragon, and wishes to give them a boon to aid their fight against this scourge of her forest, but she wishes to test their strength of character first. She will not help those who do not help others.<br><br>If the characters help the druid without reservation, read the following.<br><br><blockquote>It takes all your effort to lift the tree, knowing that you put yourselves at risk if it shifts against you. But then even as you are close to freeing the woman, the tree begins to rise on its own. Two other trees standing nearby shift back along the ground as the elf stands and smiles, showing no sign of injury. <br><br>\u201cHeroes at last!\u201d she says. \u201cHow many might fall back in fear at the sight of a stranger in the woods, or think first of their own safety before helping another? I grant you my blessing. May your hearts prove true where others fear to tread.\u201d<br><br>The woman picks flowers from her hair that you swear were not there a moment ago, then twists her fingers to weave them into garlands as if by magic. She lays a garland around each of your necks, then suddenly transforms into an owl. Her awakened tree servants stomp after her into the forest.</blockquote><br>As long as the characters wear these garlands, they are invisible to Chuth\u2019s animal spies (part of the magic imbued into the area around the dragon\u2019s lair) as they approach Neronvain\u2019s stronghold. In addition, the first time a character wearing a garland is confronted by Chuth, he or she feels a stirring warmth from the garland and automatically succeeds on the saving throw against the dragon\u2019s <br>Frightful Presence.<br><br>If the characters ignore the druid, she calls out pitifully for help as they move away, offering a last lament against their cowardice as they disappear. If the adventurers attack the druid, the awakened trees attack. They fight to the death as the druid turns into an owl and flies away.<br><br><h4>Spiders\u2019 Haunt</h4>A quarter of a mile from Chuth\u2019s lair, thin strands of spiderweb begin to be seen, hanging nearly invisible in the misty air. The webs mark the overlap between the dragon\u2019s lair and the hunting grounds of a brood of spiders. The webbing combines with the dense mist of the forest to make the area around the lair heavily obscured and difficult terrain, up to when the party reaches the pool in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTVjNDg2NTgzMGU5 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Neronvain's Stronghold</a>. Because the webs are moist, they do not burn away easily. The direct application of fire destroys webs, but fire doesn\u2019t spread among them. A character with a torch can use an action to clear the webs within reach.<br><br>As the characters advance, the webbing becomes thicker and shows birds and animals trapped within it. Any movement through the webbing alerts the 3 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODhkYzczZTQ3OTUx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ettercaps</a></strong> and 7 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NmE2OTRlZDBkNWI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>giant spiders</a></strong> lurking nearby. The ettercaps attack with web garrotes, while the spiders use the webs to drop into the party\u2019s midst. If two ettercaps or five spiders are slain, the rest flee. <br></section>", "img": ""}

The green dragon has taken over the largest cavern of the stronghold as one of its many lairs.<br><br><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTY5YjAwZmZlZTI5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Neronvain</a></strong> is served by a group of cultist bodyguards, while Chuth has won the service of a number of ettins to help guard the stronghold. The dragon also controls a terrified group of elf prisoners Neronvain brought back from one of their raids, who fight for the dragon and the wyrmspeaker unless they can be convinced to flee.<br><br>Chuth is an <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MzAwOThlNTBjZWMz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>adult green dragon</a></strong>.<hr><h3>General Features</h3><strong><em>Secret Doors.</em></strong> Secret doors inside the stronghold are little more than cracks between chambers, just large enough for Medium creatures to squeeze through. They are obscured behind loose rocks or other cover, and require a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check to notice.<br><br><strong><em>Light. </em></strong>The stronghold is dark except where otherwise noted. <hr><h3>No One Home</h3>When the characters approach the stronghold, there might be a chance that Chuth has left the caves to hunt, or that he and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTY5YjAwZmZlZTI5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Neronvain</a> are out scouting future raids. You can determine this randomly as you see fit, or allow the characters to hole up within sight of the stronghold and simply wait for the dragon and the wyrmspeaker to leave. <br><br>Removing Chuth and Neronvain from the stronghold for an initial foray allows the characters to explore and eliminate the guards without the pressure of an imminent dragon attack. This dungeon is a tough adventure even for higher-level characters, especially with the legendary actions Chuth can use in his lair. Attacking head-on if the dragon is aware of the adventurers\u2019 approach is likely a suicide mission. <hr><h3>1. Pool</h3>The pool at the foot of the waterfall is 20 feet deep at its center, its surface obscured by an emerald haze that marks this place as a green dragon\u2019s lair. <br><br>A steep slope descends from the cave behind the waterfall to the entrance to area 2, its surface slick from billowing mist. A character must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check to climb or crawl down the slope. Failure indicates that the character tumbles 40 feet down the slope, taking 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage. Characters using a rope to descend the slope can do so safely.<br><br><h4>Dragon Attack</h4>If the characters wear the garlands given to them by the druid, Chuth has no idea of their approach, allowing them to safely pass through this area and into the caves. <br><br>If the adventurers did not receive the garlands, or if they took them off for any reason while within a quarter mile of Chuth\u2019s lair, the dragon\u2019s many animal spies alert him to the party\u2019s approach. He waits at the mouth of the cave, clinging to the wall near the entrance. A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check notices movement inside the cave but can\u2019t tell what it is (or how large a creature it might be).<br><br>Chuth uses his blindsight to detect when the characters are approaching the entrance to the cave. He then dives through the waterfall, soaring above the characters as he uses his Poison Breath, attacking with surprise if no one in the party noticed him. Characters not wearing the garlands are also exposed to the dragon\u2019s Frightful Presence. Characters who fail their saving throws against Frightful Presence likely flee back into the woods, where spiders might be waiting. On the dragon\u2019s next turn, it retreats back to area 2 to await the heroes\u2019 next move.<br><hr><h3>2. Island Chamber</h3>This large chamber has a 40-foot-high ceiling set with massive stalactites, with smaller stalagmites set across the ground. A pool with a small island in the southeast corner of the cavern is fed by streams of water dripping down through the rock. The southwest face of the cavern is a 25-foot-high bluff, part of which is area 4. <br><br>The pool is 50 feet deep, and the island is a column of stone rising from its bottom. To the southeast, 25 feet below the surface of the lake, a 20-foot-wide underwater passageway leads to Chuth\u2019s lair in area 10.<br><br>If the characters did not alert Chuth to their approach, a group of elf guards (3 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzI1MzM2ZTc3ZTE3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a></strong> and 1 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTY5MmZhNzZjYjEx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>noble</a></strong>) stand at the northwest entrance to this area, driven by fear into serving the dragon (see area 4). They are expecting more cultists to arrive at the lair, and savvy characters might be able to bluff or roleplay past them. The elves demand the characters\u2019 names and ask questions they believe only true cultists would know the answers to, including knowing the identities of the cult\u2019s leaders and the structure of its ranks.<br><br>Even if they are fooled initially, the elves become suspicious if the characters begin to ask any questions that cultists should know (including questions about Neronvain, Chuth, or the stronghold). In this event, the elves call out for help and attack at once.<br><br>Any fight here draws the creatures in areas 3, 4, and 5, which fight as described below. Chuth emerges from the pool and joins the fight 3 rounds later. <br><br><h4>Dragon Attack</h4>If the characters were attacked by Chuth at the pool, the dragon clings to the ceiling in this area, using his breath weapon on the characters as soon as they enter the caves. He then crashes down on the party, focusing on elves over any other humanoids with his melee attacks. Chuth refrains from using his breath weapon if doing so might hurt or hinder his allies. <br><br>The dragon\u2019s roar signals the start of the fight for the servants of Chuth and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTY5YjAwZmZlZTI5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Neronvain</a> lying in wait for the adventurers. The elves fire bows from atop the bluff of area 4, while the ettins and cultists wade into melee beside their master. See areas 3, 4, and 5 for creature stats and information. Neronvain attacks at range from behind the cultists, staying close to the entrance to areas 5 and 6.<br><br>If the characters kill or incapacitate all of Neronvain and Chuth\u2019s servants, the dragon hides in the pool and emerges each time his breath weapon recharges. While hiding in the water, the dragon is heavily obscured.<br><br>If Neronvain is reduced to 54 hit points, he summons Chuth to his side and consumes a potion of healing. If Chuth is reduced to 78 hit points, he likewise seeks out Neronvain in the fight. The two then fall back to area 10 through the pool.<br><br><h4>Nice Day for a Swim</h4>If the characters follow Chuth and Neronvain into the pool, don\u2019t forget that the dragon is amphibious. Chuth can use any of his attacks underwater, as well as his lair actions. Characters swimming through the underwater passage might be suddenly restrained by underwater vines, making them easy targets for the dragon\u2019s Poison Breath, or putting them at risk of drowning if they cannot free themselves.<br><hr><h3>3. Ettin Lair </h3>This filthy chamber features only three huge trash mounds piled against the west walls. This place is home to 3 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGNkMjRhMjZiNzNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>ettins</a></strong>, all of which hate each other. If the adventurers make it this far undetected, the ettins assume them to be more stupid human cultists doing stupid human things. They ignore the characters as they go back to pushing each other around for \u201ctouchin\u2019 me stuff.\u201d <br><br>With a bit of clever roleplaying, the characters might be able to incite the ettins to fight one another. This costs each ettin 21 hit points and keeps them busy for 10 minutes as they wrestle and shout. <br><br>The leader of the ettins is a female named Grunda-Gurga. She has a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWE0ZWE4OWE1MTQw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>belt of hill giant strength</a></em> but wears it improperly as a sash, receiving none of its benefits and having no awareness of its magical potential.<br><hr><h3>4. Elf Quarters </h3>The tunnel leading to this area rises 20 feet to end in a rickety wooden door, constructed by the elves to keep some of the ettin smell out. This area sits atop an open bluff, with its northeast edges looking out over area 2. <br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTY5YjAwZmZlZTI5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Neronvain</a> and Chuth brought a dozen elves back from their raids in the Misty Forest as prisoners\u20148 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzI1MzM2ZTc3ZTE3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a></strong>, 3 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTY5MmZhNzZjYjEx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>nobles</a></strong> with whom Neronvain converses on occasion, and a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDA3Yzg1ODJiZGY3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>knight</a></strong> and <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjljM2ZhMDgwYzQ2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mage</a></strong> who are Chuth\u2019s playthings.<br><br>If the characters have entered the caverns undetected, any elves not on guard duty (see area 2) are here. As long as no alarm has been raised, the elves are hesitant to attack possible guests of Neronvain or Chuth, but they remain suspicious. <br><br>The elves are terrified of Chuth, and the cunning dragon has convinced them that he will free them in time if they are loyal. It takes convincing roleplaying and a DC 17 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the elves to flee rather than wait around for the dragon to eventually tire of and eat them. If the characters received the garlands from the druid and place them on the elves, this automatically convinces them to safely flee.<br><br><h4>Forgotten Shrine</h4>An ancient shrine stands in the southwest corner of the cavern, showing a young female human holding a basin. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes the shrine of Eldath, goddess of waterfalls. Water flows from cracks in the ceiling and onto the statue\u2019s head, then into the basin. The long years have etched thin white lines resembling the tracks of tears across the statue\u2019s face. <br><br>The goddess Eldath still listens at this shrine. Characters who pray for her assistance in fighting the dragon can receive a boon at your discretion, including <em>water breathing</em>, <em>bless</em>, or other useful spells.<br><hr><h3>5. Cultist Common Room </h3>This area is brightly lit by torches set into roughly carved wall sconces. Long tables made of split logs are where the cultists sit to eat or entertain themselves. A cooking fire burns in the center of the room, its smoke rising out to the central cavern and then out of the caves. <br><br>If the alarm hasn\u2019t been raised, 5 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGUyYThmZWVlODkz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonclaw</a></strong> and 1 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmJkZTc1MWIwZDUx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonfang</a></strong> cultists are at leisure here. Unless the characters are wearing cult garb and can roleplay effectively, the cultists immediately recognize them as intruders and attack.<br><hr><h3>6. Cultist Quarters </h3>Rough bunks, bedrolls, and backpacks fill this area. If the alarm hasn\u2019t yet been raised, 5 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGUyYThmZWVlODkz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonclaws</a></strong> and 1 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmJkZTc1MWIwZDUx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonfang</a></strong> cultists are asleep here.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Hidden under the mattresses in the bunks are a total of 30 gp, 120 sp, 23 ep, and 200 cp, plus a single 5 pound silver trade bar from Baldur\u2019s Gate (20 gp).<br><hr><h3>7. Storeroom </h3>The cult keeps considerable quantities of food and alcohol here. Judging by the volume of these stores, Neronvain is planning a long series of assaults against the elves of the Misty Forest.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The food is mostly common fare, but Neronvain\u2019s personal stock includes 8 bottles of Evermead, each worth 100 gp. Since contact with the elven island of Evermeet is so rare, it is easy to find a buyer. <br><hr><h3>8. Neronvain\u2019s Chambers</h3>Neronvain has created a lush living space in this rough-walled cavern, decorating it with select art and craftworks from his raids. Rich carpets and tapestries cover the floor and walls of the cavern, which features a hewn-log bed, a large mirror, and a trunk. <br><br>The entrance tunnel to this chamber is protected by a <em>glyph of warding</em> attuned to Neronvain. A DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check notices the glyph. If anyone but Neronvain steps within 5 feet of the glyph, it erupts to deal 22 (5d8) acid damage to all creatures within 20 feet of it.<br><br>A secret door is hidden behind a tapestry.<br><br>If <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTY5YjAwZmZlZTI5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Neronvain</a> is in the stronghold, he is found in this area only if the characters have managed to come this far without engaging in any combat or causing any alert to be sounded. He is otherwise encountered when he enters the fight against the characters.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>If the characters can collect all the furniture, carpets, tapestries, and art objects from this area, the lot is worth a total of 1,500 gp. However, it should occur to the characters that these goods are the rightful property of the elves they were stolen from.<br><br>The trunk is protected by a poisoned needle trap, which can be detected with a successful DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the trap is triggered, it makes an attack: +10 to hit, 1 piercing damage, and the character is subject to an unusual poison and must attempt a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the affected area (usually the hand struck by the needle) becomes numb in 30 minutes, then becomes transparent 1 hour later. After another 2 hours, the affected area painfully returns to normal as the victim takes 27 (6d8) poison damage. If the saving throw is failed, the effect progresses as above but the victim takes 54 (12d8) poison damage.<br><hr><h3>9. Secret Passage</h3>This secret room is for Neronvain\u2019s personal use only. A small shrine to Fenmarel Mestarine\u2014the elven god of outcasts, scapegoats, and solitude\u2014resembles a pair of white eyes peering out from the dark wall above a small basin.<br><br>Also present here is a journal that reveals Neronvain\u2019s relationship to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzRhMDI5ZTFlOTVm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>King Melandrach</a>, whom Neronvain refers to frequently as \u201cmy poor father.\u201d The journal also reveals that the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzQyYzdiZGNkMDBi ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Green Dragon Mask</a></em> is already at the Well of Dragons, under Severin\u2019s protection and ready to be assembled into the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2IyZjNmNTc3NTYw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Mask of the Dragon Queen</a></em>.<br><hr id=\"userscript-horizontalrule\"><h3>10. Chuth\u2019s Lair </h3>No one but the dragon and Neronvain are allowed in this area. Along the east wall is Chuth\u2019s portion of the hoard collected from the elves of the Misty Forest, though this pales in comparison to what the cult claimed for Tiamat and what the dragon possesses in his other lairs. The vaulted ceiling is 60 feet high here.<br><br>If Chuth is in the stronghold, he is initially found here only if the characters have come this far without engaging in any combat or sounding any alarm, or if he and Neronvain have retreated to the lair. If Chuth is encountered here, he uses his breath weapon, legendary actions, and lair actions indiscriminately. He tries to push powerful melee combatants back to the walls, then creates a wall of thorns to fence them in. <br><br>Because this is only a small portion of his total hoard, Chuth has no interest in dying to protect it. He flees when he is reduced to half his hit points or fewer. Neronvain fights until similarly reduced, then makes his way to Chuth and convinces the dragon to flee the caverns.<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>Chuth\u2019s small hoard contains ten gold trade bars from Baldur\u2019s Gate worth 50 gp each, plus 10 pp, 120 gp, 2,400 sp, and 8,000 cp. Feel free to add a couple useful potions or scrolls to the hoard as well.<br><br><strong><em>Roll20 Note:</em></strong> We have provided rollable tables for many of the loot tables in the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em><br></section>", "img": "modules/mod-rise-of-tiamat/journal/004_-_Episode_4_3A_Death_to_the_Wyrmspeakers_-_Neronvain/002_-_Neronvain_27s_Stronghold/avatar.png"}

The cult\u2019s awareness of the characters\u2019 opposition to their goals will have started even earlier if the characters played <em>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</em>. Either way, it doesn\u2019t take long for the cult to target the characters as a threat that must be eliminated.<br><br>Like the \u201c<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NGZhZGFjYmJiNTJm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Council of Waterdeep</a>\u201d episode, this episode is played out as separate encounters.

The cult wants its enemies to know that they aren\u2019t safe anywhere. If the characters ever split up to pursue separate missions in what seem like safe environments, the cult is almost certain to strike. <br><br><h4>Character Death</h4>Character death should always be handled carefully, but don\u2019t be afraid to kill party members in this adventure. The characters should be high enough level to cast <em>raise dead</em>, or to seek out such magic from their allies. Especially if they played through <em>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</em>, the characters have had ample opportunity to prove their worth to the Harpers, the Order of the Gauntlet, and the other factions.<br></section>", "img": "modules/mod-rise-of-tiamat/journal/005_-_Episode_5_3A_The_Cult_Strikes_Back/000_-_Introduction_to_Episode_5/avatar.png"}

The cult has no concern for innocent bystanders, but the encounter will be easier for you to run without a panicking crowd to deal with. This combat encounter should occur after a previous combat encounter has drained some of the characters\u2019 resources, but before they can finish a long rest.<hr><h3>Cult Forces</h3>The assailants the cult throws against the characters should be adjusted for the strength of the party. Using foes from the First Attack Cult Forces table, construct this first attack as a hard encounter using the guidelines in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTY0OWI0NmNmMzQ0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Creating a Combat Encounter</a>.<br><h5></h5><h4>First Attack Cult Forces</h4><table><thead><tr><td>Creature</td><td>XP Vaue</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGUyYThmZWVlODkz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Dragonclaw</a></td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTMyYjE3ZWZmNzcw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Dragonwing</a></td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmJkZTc1MWIwZDUx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Dragonfang</a></td><td>1,100</td></tr><tr><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDlhYmIwNWUwMjZh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Half-blue dragon gladiator</a></td><td>1,800</td></tr><tr><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OWU2NmY3NTg2ZjU5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Young blue dragon</a></td><td>5,000</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h3>Plan of Attack</h3>The cultists try to attack with surprise, using one of two different plans outlined below. Feel free to adapt one of these plans or devise a plan of your own. Assume that the cultists have either observed the characters for a few days or have been briefed about their targets by other spies.<br><br><strong><em>Option 1: Attack at an Inn</em></strong>. If the characters are staying at an inn, the cultists might opt for a direct assault, crashing through the front door. A more subtle approach sees them enter the inn a few at a time disguised as customers, then attacking when they have the characters outnumbered and surrounded. The dragon is unlikely to enter the inn building, opting to use its breath weapon through the windows or attacking any characters or bystanders who step outside.<br><br><strong><em>Option 2: Attack on the Road</em></strong>. As the characters are traveling, the cultists can get ahead of them and lay an ambush. Alternatively, cultists might follow the party at a distance by day, then move closer when the characters stop to rest for the night. A surprise attack in the dark or at dawn is particularly dangerous, granting the dragon complete freedom of movement and creating the possibility that some party members will be asleep or unarmored.<br><hr><h4>Conclusion</h4>Because the cult has underestimated the heroes\u2019 strength, this first assault is doomed to fail. However, try to ensure that at least one cultist escapes to report what happened. If no one gets away alive, leave signs that other cultists were hanging back as reinforcements, but fled when the original force was overwhelmed. <br><br>Make sure the characters understand what this attack was about. If it makes sense for the circumstances of the attack, the cultists will be dressed in full regalia, complete with masks and dragon-wing capes. With their last breaths, dying cultists should curse the characters and exclaim, \u201cThe dragons rise! You cannot stop us!\u201d<br><br>The characters gain a level at the end of this episode.<br></section>", "img": ""}
{"_id": "ZTU3YTdhNDM4M2U4", "name": "Second Attack", "permission": {"default": 0}, "folder": null, "flags": {"R20Converter": {"handout-order": 3, "handout-archived": false}}, "sort": 30000, "entryTime": 0, "content": "\n<section class=\"secret\"><p>GM Notes : </p><h2>Second Attack</h2>The first attack established that the heroes are an even more dangerous threat than the cult believed. In this second encounter, a stronger cult force attacks to kill.<hr><h3>Location and Timing</h3>Place this encounter at a point when the characters are not at their strongest or most well prepared. Wait until they are scattered, their spells and features are depleted by previous fighting, or they are injured and low on healing. In particular, if the attack comes during a long rest but before the characters have finished that rest, they won\u2019t yet have recovered full hit points, spells, and other resources. Such an attack puts the characters at a huge disadvantage, but reinforces that the Cult of the Dragon wants the adventurers dead.<br><br>A dramatic location works best for this attack. The cultists not only want to eliminate a threat, they want to send a message to all others who oppose them. Attacking at an important public building such as a major temple or a palace declares that no place is safe from the cult, while an assault at a large marketplace or a royal garden guarantees a maximum number of witnesses. <hr><h3>Cult Forces</h3>The second attack force comprises a team led by a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGUxMmJjYTlhNWI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonsoul</a></strong><strong> </strong>cultist. If this is an isolated fight with the characters at or near full strength, choose adversaries that create a deadly encounter. If the adventurers are weakened from earlier encounters, aim for a hard encounter instead. <br><br>Don\u2019t be reluctant to use forces that are likely to kill one or more characters. The destruction of the heroes is the goal of this attack, and if the risk of death doesn\u2019t feel real, the players won\u2019t take the threat of the cult seriously.<br><br><h4>Second Attack Cult Forces</h4><table><thead><tr><td>Creature</td><td>XP Value</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTMyYjE3ZWZmNzcw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Dragonwing</a></td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGUxMmJjYTlhNWI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Dragonsoul</a></td><td>1,800</td></tr><tr><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGZiMzYwMDkxMmNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Mezzoloth</a></td><td>1,800</td></tr><tr><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MWMzZmVhOTVhZjdh ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Nycaloth</a></td><td>5,000</td></tr><tr><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDg0OWU4MDQ1ZGM3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Adult black dragon</a></td><td>11,500</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h3>Plan of Attack</h3>These attackers know more about their targets than the first group did, thanks to the survivors from that battle.<br><br><strong><em>Option 1: Indoor Attack</em></strong>. The attackers launch their assault while the characters are visiting an important location crowded with innocent bystanders. The black dragon begins by tearing off a section of the roof to incite as much terror as possible. While the characters are distracted by that assault, invisible nycaloths move in and attack with surprise. The <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGZiMzYwMDkxMmNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mezzoloths</a> use <em>cloudkill </em>to surround the characters, unconcerned about NPCs caught up in the attack.<br><br><strong><em>Option 2: Outdoor Attack.</em></strong> An attack in a marketplace, garden, or some other outdoor location opens with the black dragon and one or more flying nycaloths appearing overhead to create a panic. The cultists are hanging on to the dragon, but they drop down to engage the party in melee while the dragon circles above, attacking with its breath weapon and using its Frightful Presence on rounds when its breath is still recharging. While the crowd inhibits the characters\u2019 movement, mezzoloths can easily and rapidly teleport through it.<br><hr><h3>Developments</h3>Don\u2019t be afraid to engage in some triumphal monologuing by the dragonsoul cultist leading the attack. Whether the attackers are winning or losing, the cultist fights with cries of \u201cThe dragons rise!\u201d and \u201cWe are unstoppable!\u201d At some point, the leader lets important information slip: \u201cThe Masks are joined, the call has sounded! Soon the Gates of the Nine Hells shall swing wide and She shall return!\u201d<br><br>As with the first assault on the adventurers, try to ensure that if the attackers are defeated, at least one escapes to report the outcome of the battle. Most easily, the dragon can fly away if the battle turns against it.<br><br>The yugoloths were summoned by Red Wizards and paid by the cult to kill the adventurers, but they have no loyalty to their benefactors. If a yugoloth takes damage from a single attack that deals more than half its remaining hit points, it withdraws from combat on its next turn. If it hasn\u2019t already tried to summon another yugoloth, it does so immediately. If it\u2019s already used that power, it simply flees, intending to regroup with other survivors later. <br><br>Because the yugoloths are mercenaries, the characters can attempt to buy them off with a better offer\u2014one that not only exceeds what the cult is paying but covers the damage to reputation that comes from changing sides in the middle of battle. A good starting offer is 10,000 gp, or 2,000 gp per yugoloth if more than five of them are in the fight.<br><br>In addition to damaging bystanders, this encounter can easily destroy buildings and great landmarks. This formidable assault should provide a sense of the destruction that will wash over the Sword Coast if the Cult of the Dragon is successful in its plans.<hr><h3>Conclusion</h3>The attackers might win this fight and kill all the characters. However, that doesn\u2019t need to end the adventure. Healers in the Order of the Gauntlet, the Harpers, and the Emerald Enclave can restore the characters to life so they can continue waging war for the forces of good. Surprisingly, dying in this battle might give the characters an advantage. When the attackers report to Severin that the meddling adventurers are dead, they\u2019ll be written off as a threat. If the raised characters make an effort to keep out of sight of the cult\u2019s spies, their next blow against the cult could come as a complete surprise.<br><br>The characters gain a level at the end of this event.<br></section>", "img": ""}

Because this attack is an all-out assault, the characters should have full access to spells, healing, and other resources.<hr><h3>Cult Forces</h3>Enough chromatic dragons have responded to the <em>Draakhorn\u2019s</em> call that a full flight of young red dragons can be dispatched to deal with the heroes once and for all. For this final assault, the cult bolsters the red dragons with a handful of cultists, half-dragons, and Red Wizards (mages) who are members of Rath Modar\u2019s splinter sect. The cultists and Red Wizards arrive on the backs of the red dragons.<br><br>Make this a deadly encounter\u2014and not just by the numbers prescribed in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTY0OWI0NmNmMzQ0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Creating a Combat Encounter</a><em>.</em> By now, the cult knows how the characters fight, and so do you. Sometimes players can make a group of characters tougher than their basic game statistics indicate. If that\u2019s the case for your group, take that into account when selecting the attacking force. <br><br><h4>Third Attack Cult Forces</h4><table><thead><tr><td>Creature</td><td>XP Value</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTMyYjE3ZWZmNzcw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Dragonwing</a></td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmJkZTc1MWIwZDUx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Dragonfang</a></td><td>1,100</td></tr><tr><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2E0YTAyNWI5NjE0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Half-red dragon gladiator</a></td><td>2,300</td></tr><tr><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjljM2ZhMDgwYzQ2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Mage</a></td><td>2,300</td></tr><tr><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NTRlZjg5NjJlZGVj ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Half-green dragon assassin</a></td><td>3,900</td></tr><tr><td><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NmFkNzk0NjZjMTQ5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Young red dragon</a></td><td>5,900</td></tr></tbody></table><br><hr><h3>Plan of Attack</h3>This encounter should challenge the adventurers in every way. The characters should be no easy match for the attacking force, such that retreat and escape might be their best option if they hope to survive. However, if the characters haven\u2019t made escape plans ahead of time, the attackers will have taken steps to make retreat impossible. The specifics are up to you, but should be based around any obvious features of the encounter area. Standard escape paths such as back doors and known sewer entrances will be watched, and tactics the characters have used before will be known. Only a special escape route\u2014a secret passage known only to a palace\u2019s most trusted servants, for example\u2014should come as a surprise to the cultists and Red Wizards. <br><br><strong><em>Frontal Assault</em></strong>. Because clever ruses and ambush have failed in previous attacks, the cult\u2019s third assault opts for overwhelming force. The dragons attack the characters from the air, attempting to draw them outside if they are indoors. When they finally face off against the adventurers, the attackers fight to kill. If the characters try to stay inside and under cover, the dragons attack whatever building they hide in, setting it ablaze. Half-dragons, cultists, and mages watch all known exits, including underground ones, to prevent the characters from slipping away. <hr><h3>Developments</h3>This battle will likely be a challenge to run. It is designed to create an emotional low spot in the adventure, during which overall defeat for the forces of good looks like a real possibility. Character death\u2014even if temporary\u2014can crush some players\u2019 spirits. <br><br>For those players, don\u2019t make this battle just a relentless slog toward death. Give the adventurers opportunities to save innocent townsfolk from being slaughtered and turn dragons away from fleeing crowds. The characters can clear burning buildings, use magic to douse flames or save the dying, and stand up for those who cannot defend themselves. Let their sacrifice during this fight mean something.<hr><h3>Conclusion</h3>Great heroes rebound from losses to fight even harder for the cause they believe in. Thanks to<em> raise dead</em>, a lost battle is a setback, not a defeat. It\u2019s a wake-up call to any players who assumed that the characters\u2019 victory was assured. The Cult of the Dragon is committed to its goal and will stop at nothing to achieve it. The characters must be even more committed to theirs.<br><br>The characters gain a level at the end of this event.<br></section>", "img": ""}

Though they are not necessarily the wisest or most powerful specimens of dragonkind, all are well respected. Any decision made by these dragon councilors will be accepted by the metallic dragons as a whole.<br><br>The dragons have no need to judge the different factions of the Sword Coast, for they know of their reputations and actions already. The dragons\u2019 attitudes are effectively fixed in that regard. However, they know also that among all the humanoid races, leaders often determine the character of societies. Though they understand that the adventurers are not the nominal leaders of any faction, the dragons already know that the heroes\u2019 actions have set the course of the factions\u2019 battle against Tiamat. As such, if the dragons side with the humanoids, it will be as a statement of personal faith in the party\u2014and in the party\u2019s ability to bring all the factions into the fight.<br><br><strong><em>Attitudes.</em></strong> Each dragon councilor has one of four attitudes in this episode, ranging from <strong>unfriendly</strong> to <strong>cautious</strong>, <strong>neutral</strong>, and <strong>friendly</strong>. To secure the cooperation of the metallic dragons as a whole, the party must conclude this episode with at least three dragon councilors having a friendly attitude and with none unfriendly. If the characters make a promise or perform an act aimed at a specific dragon, they gain a two-step improvement in the attitude of that dragon (for example, from unfriendly to neutral, or from cautious to friendly). A general concession grants a one-step improvement to a single dragon of your choosing. <br><br>Metallic dragons are exceedingly wise, but they sometimes have difficulty distinguishing individual humanoids from each other. As such, an individual dragon\u2019s initial attitude depends on the party\u2019s racial makeup\u2014and on ancient interactions and past wrongs. <br><br>See the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YWNhNDA4MGE0Zjk0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Third Session</a> of the Council of Waterdeep for information on the effects of the concessions offered by the adventurers to secure the metallic dragons\u2019 allegiance.<hr><h4>Protanther</h4><em>Male Gold Dragon<br></em><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MjNlYThmYzA3Y2Rm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Protanther</a> is the leader of the council. A former King of Justice\u2014a royal title among the gold dragons\u2014he does not care for humanoids, particularly humans and elves. Though he sees both good and bad in the lesser races, he believes that their capacity for attaining great power despite their physical limitations makes them dangerous. For all their capability, humanoids have little time to learn the wisdom to direct that capability.<br><br>The gold dragon knows that many of the world\u2019s most blighted creatures descend from humans who bargained with dark forces for power, including yuan-ti and tieflings. He considers the cycle of failed human civilizations across Faer\u00fbn as a sign of a quintessential flaw in human nature. Moreover, he is quick to point out that humans make up the majority of evil archmages and liches\u2014including Sammaster, who founded the Cult of the Dragon, and Szass Tam\u2019s Red Wizards. Even the current leader of the Cult of the Dragon, Severin, and a majority of the cult\u2019s members are human.<br><br>Protanther can at least appreciate that the crimes of the humanoid races are usually directed against each other. He knows that the short lives of many humanoids means they might not even recognize their own evil. The elves, however, live for long years and possess great knowledge\u2014and have used that knowledge to the detriment of dragonkind in the past. It was the elves who shaped the magic of the <em>Dracorage mythal</em>, causing dragons across Faer\u00fbn to go mad with rage. Convincing Protanther to trust humanoid factions that include elves is a difficult task. <br><br><strong><em>Desire.</em></strong> Protanther would prefer that the dragons rally their forces with no regard for the humanoid factions, striking immediately and decisively before the cult and its chromatic dragon allies can muster their full strength. If this puts the humanoids at risk, so be it.<br><br><strong><em>Attitude.</em></strong> Neutral. If there are humans or tieflings in the party, Protanther is instead cautious. If there are elves in the party, he is unfriendly.<br><br><strong><em>Concession.</em></strong> Protanther wants a formal apology from one who speaks for elvenkind for the abomination that was the <em>Dracorage mythal</em>. He is willing to trust that the adventurers can wring such an apology from <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzRhMDI5ZTFlOTVm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>King Melandrach</a> on the council.<br><hr><h4>Ileuthra</h4><em>Male Brass Dragon</em> <br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjRmY2ViNTQzZjZl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Ileuthra</a> is an ancient brass dragon who travels the planes in search of knowledge and ever more challenging games. Legend has it that he resides with Oghma, god of knowledge, but the dragon is cagey on that point. <br><br>Seeing good and bad in equal measure among the lesser races, Ileuthra recognizes that helping the humanoids is less a case of deciding whether they are worthy of aid, and more about deciding whether these adventurer ambassadors can be trusted to properly lead the factions. <br><br><strong><em>Desire.</em></strong> Ileuthra has no preconceived sense of what might be the best course, and he is willing to hear all sides of the discussion.<br><br><strong><em>Attitude.</em></strong> Neutral. Ileuthra has watched the lesser races for long centuries from the planes, and he understands that every individual humanoid possesses the potential for good or evil in equal measure. He is truly undecided, and will weigh all options for action against the cult. <br><br><strong><em>Concession.</em></strong> Ileuthra believes that the dragon masks are too dangerous to remain in the world if the humanoid races are aware of where they\u2019re hidden. If the characters agree that all dragon masks will be handed over to the metallic dragons as soon as they are found\u2014including any masks captured after the final battle\u2014his attitude can be improved.<br><hr><h4>Otaaryliakkarnos </h4><em>Female Silver Dragon<br></em><br>The representative of the silver dragons believes that among the lesser races, neither good nor bad is ever absolute. The humanoids are in need of protection and guidance, and should be shown Bahamut\u2019s righteous way of living rather than ignored and treated as children. If the dragons refuse to engage the humanoids and focus only on their own advancement, the humanoids will persist in making the same mistakes again and again. <br><br>Otaaryliakkarnos\u2019s faith in the potential of humanoids has something of a blind spot when it comes to dwarves, however. She resents the dwarves for their Dragonmoots of old\u2014great hunts during which clans would come together to end the perceived threat of a particular dragon. Centuries before, Otaaryliakkarnos\u2019s niece was killed in a Dragonmoot, and with the long ancestral memory of the metallic dragons, she holds all dwarves responsible. <br><br><strong><em>Attitude.</em></strong> Neutral. If the party includes one or more dwarves, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDI4NmNlMTY5Y2Ux ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Otaaryliakkarnos</a> is instead unfriendly.<br><br><strong><em>Desire.</em></strong> Otaaryliakkarnos would like the metallic dragons to strike now as Protanther suggests, but she does not know if they can succeed alone. An alliance would reduce casualties for all parties, but the dragons must be certain of the intentions of the factions and their leaders.<br><br><strong><em>Concession.</em></strong> Otaaryliakkarnos knows that the skin of her slain kin was used to make armor for the dwarf lord who slew her. She demands the remains be returned and that Ambassador Brawnanvil make an apology on behalf of all dwarves for the wrongful deaths the Dragonmoots have caused.<br><hr><h4>Nymmurh</h4><em>Male Bronze Dragon<br></em><br>Of all the dragons on the council, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzBhZmZlMDA1ZGUw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Nymmurh</a> disagrees most strongly with Protanther. He knows that the metallic dragons are made in the image of Bahamut, and have no choice in the matter of being good or evil. Thus, how much greater and more precious is good when it is freely chosen by the humanoids, who must consciously turn away from villainy?<br><br>Nymmurh\u2019s belief in the potential of humanoids is partly driven by his affection for and protection of the noble Silmerhelve human family in Waterdeep (including Dala Silmerhelve; see the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZjY5NjlhZTI1NmNh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Second Session</a> of the Council of Waterdeep).<br><br><strong><em>Desire.</em></strong> Nymmurh would like to help the factions, looking to the Harpers and the Order of the Gauntlet as epitomizing the best traits of humanoid aspiration. <br><br><strong><em>Attitude.</em></strong> Unless the party has engaged in problematic behavior in his presence (or where he would hear of it), Nymmurh is friendly. He knows that the characters come to the council on the recommendation of those he respects and loves. <br><br><strong><em>Concession.</em></strong> Nymmurh needs no concession unless the characters have somehow offended him. In such a scenario, the adventurers must prove their worth and goodness in a way you deem suitable.<br><hr><h4>Tazmikella</h4><em>Female Copper Dragon<br></em><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDM1YzFmOGRiMzQw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Tazmikella</a> is fond of humans and has spent a great deal of time living among them, but she has reservations about supporting the factions. Her lair and hoard have been the target of cunning thieves and fast-talking swindlers more than once, and she perceives betrayal as a humanoid trait. She fears what might happen if one or more factions turn against the metallic dragons to demonstrate loyalty to Tiamat.<br><br>The copper dragon also believes that unrestricted interaction between humanoids and dragons has been disastrous for both races. The <em>Dracorage mythal</em> serves as a sore reminder of the animosity that has often arisen between the two peoples. <br><br><strong><em>Desire.</em></strong> Tazmikella agrees with Protanther that the metallic dragons could strike against the chromatic dragons themselves. However, she is not convinced they would succeed, and having humanoid allies would reduce casualties for both sides.<br><br><strong><em>Attitude.</em></strong> Neutral. If any character is a dragonborn, Tazmikella is instead cautious. If the party contains any character with a personal reputation for shady dealings (particularly a rogue or bard), she is unfriendly. <br><strong><em><br>Concession.</em></strong> Pick one magic item owned by a member of the party, and which was found during a previous adventure. That item turns out to have once belonged to Tazmikella, and was part of a hoard she took from an ancient black dragon she defeated. (<em>Legend lore</em> or similar magic used on the item confirms this story.) The item holds sentimental value to her\u2014or it did until a thief stole it from her hoard. Returning the item to her with an apology improves Tazmikella\u2019s attitude.<hr><h3>General Concessions</h3>The party can make general concessions to the dragons to appease them as a group, rather than make personal concessions to individual dragons. A general concession improves the attitude of a single dragon of your choice by one step.<br><br><strong><em>Wealth.</em></strong> Even good dragons love treasure, and bestowing a share of the hoard the cult has collected for Tiamat goes a long way toward improving the attitudes of the council dragons. The party can effectively treat the dragons as another faction receiving an equal portion of the hoard, granting one share of the total treasure divided among eleven factions. Doing so improves the attitude of a single dragon by one step. For every additional share the dragons are promised (two shares among twelve factions, three shares among thirteen factions, and so on), the party improves the attitude of another dragon by one step.<br><br>The attitude of the dragons is improved by wealth in the following order: <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDM1YzFmOGRiMzQw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Tazmikella</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDI4NmNlMTY5Y2Ux ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Otaaryliakkarnos</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjRmY2ViNTQzZjZl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Ileuthra</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MjNlYThmYzA3Y2Rm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Protanther</a>, and <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MzBhZmZlMDA1ZGUw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Nymmurh</a>. Promising one-third (five shares among fifteen factions) or more of the treasure improves the attitude of all five dragons.<br><br><strong><em>Other Promises.</em></strong> The dragons do not prompt the party with options, but the characters can potentially sway them with other offers. Reward player ingenuity for options such as the following:<br><ul><li>A promise to turn over Severin as a prisoner if he is captured, or to deliver his body to the dragons if he is slain. </li><li>Consecrating a major monastery or temple to Bahamut.</li><li>Dedicating a historical plot of land as belonging to the dragons.</li></ul><hr><h4>Have We Met Before?</h4>The dragons on the council have lived for centuries. Given how quickly humanoids build up progeny, it is possible that one of the dragons encountered a particular character\u2019s ancestors and recognizes the character by smell. Perhaps the dwarf who killed Otaaryliakkarnos\u2019s relative was the long-lost grand-uncle of the party\u2019s dwarf cleric. Or perhaps Tazmikella\u2019s stolen magic item is not something currently possessed by one of the adventurers, but she recognizes an ancestor of a party member as the sweet-talking bard who stole it generations before. The character can recognize the item as a family heirloom, and will need to make arrangements to have it returned.<br><br><h4>A Relic for Just Such an Occasion </h4>Metallic dragons are known to bestow magic and treasure from their hoards to help heroes from time to time. If the characters do an excellent job impressing the dragons\u2014for example, bringing all five dragons up to an attitude of friendly\u2014or if they roleplayed the encounter well, the council dragons might grant one or more characters with a token of their esteem. This is likely a set of 3 <em>arrows of dragon slaying</em>, or <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NmQ5ZTBhNmVhYWUw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>plate armor of lightning resistance</a></em>. Either will prove useful against the cult, especially if the characters have yet to play the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=M2IzMmZhZDlmYjgz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Xonthal\u2019s Tower</a> episode. Tazmikella can even return the item the characters gave to her as a concession. (She does not covet it when it might do others good, but simply resents having had it stolen.)<br></section>", "img": ""}

Many such elements center around scholars and academics, for whom the cult\u2019s new focus has made their knowledge and research irrelevant. Others think that Severin is being taken in by devils and that Tiamat will play him for a fool\u2014a notion fairly close to the truth. <br><br>Two of the leading dracolich traditionalists\u2014a dragonsoul named Jorgen Pawl and his trusted lieutenant Iskander\u2014have been most vocal in their objections. As the time of the summoning ritual approaches, Severin understands that he can\u2019t risk losing loyal troops to infighting and insurrection. He has thus agreed to give Jorgen Pawl and his followers a dragon mask to examine, allowing them to determine whether Severin\u2019s understanding of the masks\u2019 power is correct. If Severin is wrong, he will know before risking everything on a do-or-die gamble. If he is right, the traditionalists will give their support to Severin\u2019s plans.<br><br>What Jorgen does not know is that Severin asked his Red Wizard allies to create a false mask, supplying the scholar with a duplicate of the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTdkMzZmNmFiYmNk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Blue Dragon Mask</a></em> that appears both powerful and inscrutable, though it holds little in the way of real magic. Severin knows the scholars will discover the deception eventually, but he hopes that the false mask will keep the traditionalists occupied while he completes his plans.<br><br>The Cult of the Dragon recently took control of Xonthal\u2019s Tower\u2014an ancient and mysterious wizard\u2019s tower on the southern slope of Mount Hlim. Although not all the cult members at Xonthal\u2019s Tower are dracolich traditionalists, Jorgen Pawl and Iskander are in command there, and they have drawn many likeminded individuals under their sway.<hr><h3>Iskander </h3><em>Neutral evil male human wizard<br></em><br>The young second-in-command at Xonthal\u2019s Tower stands an impressive 6-feet-5-inches tall. Iskander is not overly brave, but he is observant. One fact that hasn\u2019t escaped his notice is the number of rising stars in the Cult of the Dragon who meet mysterious ends before reaching their full potential. The suspicion that some cultists practice \u201cadvancement through assassination\u201d or eliminate ambitious underlings to safeguard their own positions preys heavily on Iskander\u2019s mind. <br><br>Four tendays past, <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YmIxNzY0YjIyZjEz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Iskander</a> came down with a stomach affliction that left him critically weak.

To save himself, Iskander has decided to betray the cult and seek safety elsewhere.

The cultists avoid the hedge maze by accessing a portal inside the tower that they use to travel in and out.<br><br>The wizard Xonthal was an extraordinary figure. Beginning as a lowly adventurer, he traveled across Faer\u00fbn and beyond, reaching distant Zakhara, Kara-Tur, and even Maztica. His work focused on conjuration and elemental evocation, so he often kept elementals and genies for company.<br><br>Xonthal prized solitude, so he designed his tower and its surrounding hedge maze to deter intruders and unwanted visitors. Over a century ago, the wizard kicked his apprentices out and sealed the tower. No one knows what Xonthal has been up to in the intervening decades, or whether he\u2019s even still alive. Some think he must have become a lich, while others believe he\u2019s just dead. All that\u2019s certain is that the hedge maze remains a frustrating barrier, and the spells and wards protecting the tower against entry remain as powerful as ever.<hr><h3>The Village</h3>Spreading out along the edge of the hedge maze is a village, also called Xonthal\u2019s Tower. The settlement began as a place where Xonthal\u2019s many apprentices established homes of their own. As years passed, more settlers were drawn to the area as word spread that the wizard and his apprentices offered excellent protection against marauding orcs and monsters. The village is smaller now than in the tower\u2019s heyday, but about three hundred people still live there. <br><br>The locals are friendly enough, but they\u2019re wary of strangers who ask too many questions about the tower. Things were quiet there for a long time, but for almost a year now, the villagers have seen lights through the windows at night and heard unearthly sounds. A few claim to have seen a blue dragon lingering in the sky high above. Some villagers scoff at that idea, but everyone agrees that the tower has been reoccupied. <br><br>Once the villagers are satisfied that the adventurers haven\u2019t come to lay waste to the tower (fearing that an all-out battle would likely destroy the village too), they\u2019re interested in talking of little else besides who could be inside. The most popular theories are that Xonthal has returned or has awakened as a lich, or that one of the genies and elementals he once imprisoned finally broke free of its restraints but remains trapped inside the tower. <br><br>The villagers warn the characters sternly about the danger of entering the maze. Few who enter it ever come back out, and those who do come out are much worse for wear. Even animals and birds avoid the maze.<br><br>The tower and the maze are protected by brilliantly crafted <em>wishes </em>cast by Xonthal. The tower is impervious to all scrying and divination, and invulnerable against all forms of attack and alteration. Approaching through the maze and overcoming the puzzles designed by Xonthal is the only way to get inside. <br></section>", "img": ""}
{"_id": "ZGJhODg2N2JhODVk", "name": "The Maze", "permission": {"default": 0}, "folder": null, "flags": {"R20Converter": {"handout-order": 3, "handout-archived": false}}, "sort": 30000, "entryTime": 0, "content": "\n<section class=\"secret\"><p>GM Notes : </p><h2>The Maze</h2>The hedge maze surrounding the central tower is an astounding work of magical construction. In certain regards, it\u2019s even more impressive than the tower because of the powerful ways it manipulates space.<br><br>A gently curving path leads into the maze from the edge of the village. The villagers built a low fence across the entrance to keep young children and animals from wandering in. Fear of the maze is hammered into all other residents of the village from the time they\u2019re old enough to appreciate its dangers, and they shun it diligently.<br><br>Seen from above\u2014either by a flying character or from nearby rooftops\u2014the maze appears to be an overgrown, tangled mess with no discernible paths longer than a dozen yards. It looks exactly like what it is: a hedge maze left untended for more than a century, grown into a nearly solid mass of hedge and thorn.<br><br>Seen from ground level, however, the maze appears to be a pleasant, hedge-ringed garden with no resemblance to a maze at all. Villagers are quick to point out this anomaly, to prove to the characters that the maze is nothing to take lightly. The view from above reveals the maze as it exists in the real world. The view up the path from ground level looks into the extradimensional space that Xonthal crafted as a barrier around his home.<br><br>The tower\u2019s entrance exists only within this extradimensional space. Entering the maze any other way than walking up the main path quickly leads characters into densely tangled brush that is all but impassable, and that doesn\u2019t physically connect to any tower entrance. Characters who cut their way through to the tower, fly across to it, or tunnel beneath the maze to the outside wall find only smooth, unbroken stone that cannot be breached or bypassed by any means. A balcony juts out from the top level of the tower, but it is surrounded by an invisible, impenetrable barrier that deflects all objects and effects. The only way to reach the tower\u2019s entrance is through Xonthal\u2019s extradimensional maze.<hr><h3>General Features</h3>Because the maze doesn\u2019t exist in normal space, it cannot be traditionally mapped. Instead, it is shown here as a set of seven nodes where encounters occur. Moving between two nodes takes 2d6 rounds regardless of whether characters walk or run. Characters experience such movement as if walking down a well-groomed path in a hedge garden. The path curves so that characters can\u2019t see more than 15 feet ahead, exactly as if they were in a circular garden with concentric paths. Cutting through hedges has no effect on how long it takes characters to get from one node to the next. Characters who return to look for a spot previously cut through will never find it. <br><br>The hedge walls are 8 feet tall, allowing the adventurers to see the tower above them from many locations. This view provides no clue to direction, however. Characters who see the tower to the left one moment might spot it to the right, or behind, or closer or farther away a moment later. When trying to focus on the tower\u2019s new location, characters suddenly find that they can\u2019t remember its old location clearly, or begin to wonder if it was in its current spot all along. <br><br>If a character who entered the extradimensional maze along the path tries to fly above it once inside, the tower immediately fades from view, and the view becomes endless hedge-lined paths stretching to the horizon in every direction. Alternatively, characters who fly above the maze are shunted back into the real world, emerging above the hedge tangle with their companions nowhere in sight. The only way for them to rejoin the party is to enter the maze again and retrace their steps, dealing with all encounters along the way. (Use this option carefully if you\u2019re not a fan of splitting the party.)<br><br>If the characters enter the maze at night, starlight from a clear sky is bright enough for them to find their way through\u2014and even bright enough for the sundial in area 1 to cast a shadow. However, anyone with a passing familiarity of the sky notices that the constellations are completely unfamiliar.<br><br>Area 1 is the heart of the maze, and characters will return there many times as they seek the entrance to the tower. If they do things correctly, they won\u2019t need to face any of the maze\u2019s dangers. That\u2019s unlikely, though.<br><br>Although the maze is devilishly hard to get through, it\u2019s easy to leave. All the characters need to do is express a desire to leave the maze while they\u2019re in area 1, and whatever route they take next leads them back to the entrance and the path at the edge of the village. They can turn around and come back in again, and they\u2019ll wind up in area 1, at the start of the maze.<hr><h3>Rescue Mission</h3>Unless the characters took extreme measures to hide their approach to the maze, they are spotted by the cultists in the tower. (The cultists watch the village closely, and immediately recognize any stir caused by the adventurers\u2019 arrival.) The cultists don\u2019t know the adventurers\u2019 plans, but with the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZTdkMzZmNmFiYmNk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Blue Dragon Mask</a></em> on hand, they don\u2019t intend to take chances. Their preparations alarm Iskander, who sees his chance for escape dwindling. In a panic, he grabs the <em>Blue Dragon Mask </em>and dashes to the tower balcony.<br><br>As the characters prepare to enter the maze for the first time, or if they are spending too long in the village, read or paraphrase the following.<br><br><blockquote>As you prepare to step onto the garden path, you notice movement high up on the tower. A human male dressed in black robes stands on the balcony, waving something over his head. It\u2019s hard to make out details from this distance, but it might be a blue mask. <br><br>\u201cHeroes,\u201d the figure screams, \u201cthey saw you in the village! I\u2019ve taken the mask, but they\u2019ll realize it\u2019s missing within minutes! Look for me beneath the tower, for it\u2019s the only place I have a chance to hide. This is the key that will let you teleport into the dungeon.\u201d As he speaks, the figure holds aloft a second item\u2014some sort of white, glimmering hourglass. \u201cI will leave it behind after I use it, but others may find it before you do.\u201d<br><br>The speaker looks over his shoulder as another figure suddenly dashes out onto the balcony. A flash of blades and spell-fire erupts. Then the figure who spoke pitches his attacker over the railing before dashing back inside.</blockquote><hr><h3>1. The Sundial</h3>After walking up the entrance path into the maze, this is the first area the characters arrive at, entering along pathway E.<br><br><blockquote>You\u2019ve entered an intersection where eight paths converge symmetrically. You can see Xonthal\u2019s Tower dead ahead above the hedge wall, but the way the paths curve, there\u2019s no telling which one might lead to it. <br><br>A sundial stands in the center of the intersection, the shadow from its gnomon pointing straight toward the tower\u2014which is highly odd, because the sun isn\u2019t behind you. Your shadows point in the proper direction. Only the sundial\u2019s shadow points ahead. </blockquote><br>The sundial is anchored to the ground and cannot be moved or shifted. The eight paths leading out of this area are identical. If the characters try to make any identifying marks on the ground or leave items in this area, the marks and items are gone the next time they arrive here. The adventurers shouldn\u2019t know whether they\u2019re coming back to the same spot each time or whether more than one identical sundial intersection exists in the maze. <br><br>The sundial\u2019s shadow indicates the correct path. If the characters follow one of the paths not indicated by the sundial, it leads them to one of the other areas of the maze (your choice). There is no turning back from a wrong path. Once the last character has gone out of sight of the sundial (15 feet along the curving path), reversing direction delivers all characters to the same area they would have reached if they\u2019d kept going forward.<br><br>If the characters take the correct path, they return to area 1 after 2d6 rounds. Each time they return, the sundial points toward a different path, in the order presented below. However, each time the characters enter this area after the first, the gnomon casts more than one shadow. The adventurers must deduce the correct path from among multiple shadows, but those solutions aren\u2019t obvious or even fair. Xonthal was trying to keep enemies and curiosity-seekers out\u2014not just to present them with an enjoyable mental challenge.<br><br><h5>Sundial Shadows</h5><table><thead><tr><td>Sundial</td><td>Shadows Point At</td><td>Correct Path</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>A</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>A, C</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>A, D, F</td><td>E</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>B, D, F, H</td><td>Sundial</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>A\u2013H</td><td>Edge of hedge</td></tr></tbody></table><br>The<strong> first three sundials</strong> are straightforward, even if the solutions are not always obvious. <br><br>The <strong>fourth sundial</strong> casts four shadows in an \u201cX\u201d shape. As the characters examine them, the shadows start slowly rotating around the face of the sundial, spinning faster and becoming shorter until they shrink into the gnomon and the sundial shows no shadow at all. The correct path in this case is the sundial itself. A character who jumps or climbs onto the sundial is drawn into its stone surface, then is suddenly dropped out of the sky to land harmlessly around sundial 5.<br><br>The<strong> fifth sundial </strong>casts eight shadows that point at every possible pathway. No path is the right one. To correctly bisect the shadows, characters must move between the paths, straight into the end of any hedge. As soon as a character steps, runs, or dives headlong into a hedge, he or she emerges safely at the foot of the tower. <br><br>Each time the characters choose a wrong path, they emerge at one of the other maze areas described below, which you can use in any order you like. If the characters make the wrong choice more than six times, you can reuse areas, create new ones of your own, or let the characters wander down a path much longer than usual before encountering the sundial again.<br><br>Characters always return to the same sundial puzzle they most recently departed (sundial 1 through 5), so that they do not need to retrace their steps from the very beginning after each wrong turn. However, they have no way to tell whether they have returned to the same specific sundial, as noted above.<br><br><h4>Completing the Maze</h4>When the characters complete the maze by successfully entering the hedge at the fifth sundial, they emerge within sight of a teleportation circle at the foot of the tower. The body of a dead cultist lies sprawled on the ground (the one Iskander threw off the balcony earlier). Behind them, the characters see a straight path that leads directly to the sundial intersection. Another path extends thirty yards beyond the sundial, ending at the exit to the village. <br><br>A few seconds after the first character steps onto the circle, all creatures in the circle are teleported to <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDYyZjg3Y2JmZDVl ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area 8</a> of the tower. Alternatively, the characters can walk out of the garden from the foot of the tower without any detours or difficulties. However, any gems they collected in the maze (see below) will mysteriously vanish from their possession.<br><br><h4>Splitting the Party</h4>Some parties are going to try splitting up in the hope of outwitting the maze. No matter how the characters attempt to do so, however, they always wind up back together. If groups take separate paths, they meet at the same destination. If one character stays at the sundial while others take a path, that path leads back to the sundial where the character is waiting. Moreover, that character swears that the others have been gone for 1d6 hours\u2014long enough to gain the benefit of a short rest (though taking a long rest is impossible in the maze). As usual, any identifying marks made in the area vanish during those hours without anyone noticing.<hr><h3>2. Chuul Pool</h3><blockquote>Filling the center of this eighty-foot-square courtyard is a circular pool of water sixty feet across. The water is dark and murky, reducing visibility to about one foot. A garnet gemstone hovers one foot above the center of the pool. Another path leaves the area through the hedge wall on the far side of the pool, directly opposite where you entered. </blockquote><br>Four<strong> [</strong><strong>chuuls] </strong>dwell in this dark water. They stay hidden as long as the characters remain in the courtyard, but attack any creature that enters the pool or touches the gem. Attacking chuuls try to paralyze characters, then drag or throw them into the 50-foot-deep pool to drown them. They are fascinated by magic, though, and if any magic item is dropped into the pool, the chuuls are distracted for 5 rounds. They won\u2019t attack during that time, and if they were already attacking, they stop and dive to the bottom of the pool to inspect their new treasure.<br><br>If the characters attempt to leave the area without retrieving the garnet, both paths curve away and bring them back here after a short walk. If the characters leave any marks, items, or companions behind in this area, all the same conditions apply here as in area 1.<br><br>If the garnet is carried out of this area, either path leads the characters back to the sundial<br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The bottom of the pool holds the treasure that\u2019s been dropped in by various visitors: six <em>potions of healing</em>, one<em> potion of growth</em>, one <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDYwNWEwMWI2NDA4 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>potion of fire breath</a></em>, a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OTAxODFiOWVkNzY3 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>wand of fear</a></em> (3 charges), three <em>+1 daggers</em>, a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MjM4Y2U2MTUyZjli ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>driftglobe</a></em>, and an <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzJjMjM3OWZiNDdh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>elemental gem</a></em> (clear sapphire/air elemental).<hr><h3>3. Cyclopes\u2019 Pasture</h3><blockquote>You emerge from the path into an area far larger than any open area you expected to encounter in the maze garden. This rectangular space must be ninety feet across, with its far side almost 150 feet away. It looks like a boulder-strewn pasture, with a large pond to one side and a fenced vegetable garden and oversized cottage on the other. Sheep graze in the pasture, tended by a pair of cyclopes, but none of them are moving. They all appear frozen in time. </blockquote><br>As soon as any character advances into the area, the creatures here spring to life, with the sheep grazing and the cyclopes chatting idly with each other. When the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZWY5NTVhMmM5YjNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cyclopes</a> notice the characters, they exchange a few unheard words, then play some sort of game analogous to rock/paper/scissors. One loses, and both cyclopes approach the characters. They don\u2019t appear to be carrying weapons. <br><br>When the cyclopes are within 20 feet of the characters, the one that lost the game scoops up a small boulder from the ground and gestures toward the party. He then looks downfield and heaves the boulder 100 feet, where it bounces and rolls another 20 feet. Both cyclopes then turn and look at the characters expectantly.<br><br>The boulders at this end of the field are all at least 2 feet in diameter and weigh 500 pounds or more. <br><br>The cyclopes speak only Giant. If any character addresses them in that language, they ignore any questions but explain the rules of their game: the characters\u2019 boulder must fly farther than the cyclops\u2019s. How the characters accomplish this is unimportant to the cyclopes, but the boulder can\u2019t be dragged or carried\u2014it must fly at least part of the distance. <br><br>The characters can beat this challenge in several ways. The most straightforward solution is to reduce the boulder with an <em>enlarge/reduce</em> spell, then use the same spell to enlarge a strong character to throw it. Other solutions might involve casting <em>levitate </em>on the rock and giving it a push, digging a trench for the rock to roll down the length of the field, or propelling it with magic in some other way. The cyclopes will accept any solution the characters attempt, as long as it propels the stone farther than the cyclops did. <br><br>Each <strong>cyclops </strong>defends itself if attacked, and killing them changes nothing. The characters still need to propel a stone farther than the cyclops did to get back to the sundial.<br><br>When the characters beat the challenge, the stone that the cyclops threw splits in half, revealing a topaz gemstone inside. If the topaz is carried out of this area, either path leads the characters back to the sundial. <br><br>If the characters attempt to leave the area without winning the contest, both paths curve away and bring them back here after a short walk. If the characters leave any marks, items, or companions behind in this area, all the same conditions apply here as in area 1. <hr><h3>4. Carnivorous Garden</h3><blockquote>Ahead, you see a bubbling fountain filling the pathway. Large bright flowers grow in the hedges on both sides of the fountain, each blossom shimmering in the light. The air smells particularly fresh and sweet here. </blockquote><br>A large flower grows on each northern and southern side of each square on the map except the square with the fountain. As the characters get closer, they can see that the shimmering of the flowers comes from a large pearl set into each one. However, if any of these<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2UzNjFiZDI1NmU2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>carnivorous flowers</a></strong> is attacked, or if a character tries to remove a pearl from a flower, all twelve flowers attack any enemy they can reach. They have speed 0 and the plant type. <br><br>Once a flower is killed, its pearl can be removed. If a pearl is carried out of this area, either path leads the characters back to the sundial. <br><br>If the characters attempt to leave the area without a pearl, both paths curve away and bring them back here after a short walk. If the characters leave marks, items, or companions behind in this area, all the same conditions apply here as in area 1. <hr><h3>5. Pagoda</h3><blockquote>A placid pond fills the center of this open space. A stout pagoda rises from a huge boulder that stands in the water like an island. An arched bridge crosses the water to the pagoda, whose red roof is held up by six sturdy pillars and capped with carved fish. A human male wearing yellow silk robes embroidered with red and gold fish stands in the pagoda. You hear exotic music being played on a stringed instrument. </blockquote><br>When the characters arrive, the robed figure bows to them, moves into the pagoda, and sits down on the boulder where it protrudes through the floor of the pagoda. He waits patiently for the party to join him. Around the boulder, the floor of the pagoda is not wood, but rather is a rock garden of decorative stones and brushed sand. A charcoal pit smolders beside the boulder where the man sits. <br><br>The master of the pagoda does not speak, and he waits as long as it takes for the adventurers to follow him. When they enter the pagoda, he gives a brief smile and proffers silk cushions. He then waves his hand and an iron tea kettle rises up from beneath the embers. The kettle resembles a scowling face with thick features, and a character who studies it may recognize it as a dao with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Arcana) check. The man pours clear water from a clay jug into the kettle and adds tea leaves. He bows to the kettle and shows great reverence to the vessel, then lowers his head in meditation. Soon steam rises from the kettle. <br><br>The tea brewer is a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGI4MzQzOWU2Mjky ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dao</a> </strong>magically disguised as a human, and the pot brews not tea but a deadly gaseous poison. The tea kettle is also the dao\u2019s <em>magic jar</em> (described below).<br><br>With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, a character realizes that an innate ability lifted the teapot from the coals (<em>move earth</em> acting on a small clay column). Characters who watch the leaves going into the kettle can attempt a DC 13 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Medicine) check. Success indicates the character recognizes drakeswort, a potentially lethal herb. <br><br>If characters do nothing, the steeping drakeswort fills the pagoda with poisonous vapor, and the dao encloses the pagoda in a <em>wall of stone</em> (including the roof), trapping the poison and the characters inside. He uses Earth Glide to sink into the boulder. With his body safe beneath the ground, his soul jumps into the tea kettle, and he monitors the characters\u2019 escape attempts and enjoys watching their suffering. For the next 3 minutes (30 rounds), creatures inside the pagoda (except the dao in his <em>magic jar</em>) must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against poison at the start of each of their turns. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage, or half damage on a successful save. Three successful saving throws in a row confer immunity to the poison.<br> <br>Trapped characters have several options for escape: <br><br><ul><li>The stone walls are AC 5, 6 inches thick, and have 15 hit points per inch of thickness (90 hp total). Motivated characters can create air holes in the walls.</li><li>Dumping the kettle into the fire reduces damage to 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half damage on a successful save. Smoke from burning drakeswort is less dangerous than steam.</li><li>Plugging the kettle\u2019s spout or extinguishing the fire reduces the saving throw DC to 8. </li><li>Damaging the tea kettle forces the dao to return to the pagoda. When the dao\u2019s soul inhabits the kettle, the face is slightly animated. Anyone touching the kettle notices the eyes looking around the pagoda. The kettle has AC 5 and 20 hit points. If it takes more than 10 points of damage, the dao returns to his body, emerges from the stone, drops the <em>wall of stone</em> (because he can\u2019t breathe the poison either), and attacks.</li></ul><br>If characters attack the dao before his trap is sprung, he fights back, making full use of <em>invisibility</em>, <em>move earth</em>, and his other abilities. He shifts the odds in his favor by killing the weakest characters first. The dao fights to 45 hit points or fewer, then retreats into the earth. <br><br>A jade gemstone sits inside the teapot. If it is carried out of this area, either path leads characters back to the sundial. <br><br>If characters leave the area without the jade gemstone, both paths curve away and bring them back here after a short walk. If the characters leave marks, items, or companions behind in this area, all the same conditions apply here as in area 1.<hr><h3>6. Statue Gallery</h3><blockquote>Six suits of ornate plate mail stand in this area as if on guard. Battered and bashed pieces of armor and weapons are scattered across the carpeted floor before them. Moss and lichen cover the armor, though it remains free of rust. Another pathway opens up at the far side of this area.</blockquote><br>When the characters begin exploring the area, two suits of <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MGEyYjk0MGU3ZGE2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>animated armor</a></strong> swing into motion and attack. Each time a suit of armor is destroyed, two more activate. When there are no more suits of armor to activate, the suits reassemble themselves from the components littering the ground as long as any character remains in this area. <br><br>Each time a suit of armor is destroyed, roll a d6. On a roll of 6, a large bloodstone rolls out of the armor as its pieces fall to the ground. If the bloodstone is carried out of this area, either path leads the characters back to the sundial. <br><br>If the characters leave the area without a bloodstone, both paths curve away and bring them back here after a short walk. If the characters leave marks, items, or companions behind in this area, all the same conditions apply here as in area 1.<hr><h3>7. Gorgon Maze</h3>As they follow the path, the characters are drawn into a maze within the larger maze of the magical garden. <br><br><blockquote>The curving path you follow suddenly twists to reveal a proper maze cut out of the surrounding hedges. Moments later, the pounding of hooves rings out, and a gorgon charges out of the greenery toward you.</blockquote><br>This area is ringed by unbroken hedge walls that make it impossible to escape. The characters won\u2019t know this until they explore the area fully, and they won\u2019t have time to do that with a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDk3YTMxOTdlZjRm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>gorgon</a> </strong>on the loose.<br><br>The maze permits the gorgon to move freely through the hedges when it uses its Trampling Charge attack. As it races after the adventurers, it attacks with its Petrifying Breath as often as it can. Each time it does so, a diamond crystallizes from its breath and drops to the ground. A character can spot the gem with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

Once inside, they learn that Iskander\u2019s fellow cultists have discovered his treason and are trying to kill him. The characters must figure out the tower\u2019s magical teleportation system, then defeat both the cultists and some of Xonthal\u2019s original defenses to rescue Iskander and claim the dragon mask he promised them. Before the characters can leave, however, they must deal with the blue dragon summoned to protect the mask.<br><br>Though the tower appears square from the outside, its chambers and walls are circular when seen from inside. This strange incongruity is another manifestation of Xonthal\u2019s ability to manipulate space. <br><hr><h3>General Features</h3><strong><em>Ceilings</em></strong>. Chambers in the tower have 10-foot-high ceilings.<br><br><strong><em>Light</em></strong>. Areas 8 to 13 are brightly lit by narrow windows and magic lamps.<br><br><strong><em>Sound</em></strong>. The structure of the tower muffles sound between levels. Only the loudest shouting or noise can be heard on an adjacent level, and nothing short of an explosion or a <em>thunderwave </em>spell can be heard more than one level away.<br><br><strong><em>Teleport Circles</em></strong>. The aboveground levels of Xonthal\u2019s Tower contain no stairs. The only way to pass from one level to another is by using teleport circles built into the tower (marked \u201cT\u201d on the map). Because they aren\u2019t climbing up or down, characters have no way to know which level they\u2019re on after teleporting except by looking out the windows. The tall windows in the tower are too narrow for any creature more than a few inches wide to pass through. <br><br>On the wall behind each teleport circle is a metal panel inscribed with symbols. Touching a symbol causes it to glow softly. A few seconds later, all creatures standing in the circle teleport to the area selected by the symbol. <br><br><h5>Teleport Symbols</h5><table><thead><tr><td>Symbol</td><td>Destination</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chair</td><td>Audience chamber (area 8)</td></tr><tr><td>Two Chairs*</td><td>Audience chamber balconies</td></tr><tr><td>Upside-down \u201cL\u201d</td><td>Closed chambers (area 9)</td></tr><tr><td>Rectangle</td><td>Shrine (area 10)</td></tr><tr><td>Flame</td><td>Lounge (area 11)</td></tr><tr><td>Star</td><td>Observatory (area 12)</td></tr><tr><td>Square</td><td>Bedroom (area 13)</td></tr><tr><td>Hourglass</td><td>Dungeon teleporter (locked\u2014area 14)<br></td></tr><tr><td>Right Triangle</td><td>Sundial area of the hedge maze <br>(area 1; not accessible from the <br>dungeon)</td></tr></tbody></table>*Appears in the audience chamber (area 8) only. The specific balcony is determined by which chair is touched.<br><br>Characters who touch the right triangle return to the sundial seen from the foot of the tower, allowing them to return to the tower along the straight path or to exit the maze to the village (see \u201cCompleting the Maze,\u201d in the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZGJhODg2N2JhODVk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Maze</a> handout).<br><br>To teleport down to the dungeon level, the symbol must be touched by the hourglass-shaped key that Iskander waved from the balcony. Xonthal conducted many dangerous experiments in the dungeons, and he didn\u2019t want anyone getting into that level\u2014or getting out of it\u2014without his approval. <br><br>The key is a representation of an hourglass made of ivory and crystal. Iskander used the key to escape into the dungeon from the observatory, but tossed the key back into the room after using it so the adventurers could follow him down. Jorgen Pawl found the key and has it now. The characters must take the key from him to reach the dungeon level. <hr><h3>8. Audience Chamber</h3><blockquote>The walls of this chamber bear exotic geometric designs representing feathers, eagles, and snakes, all rendered in a style you\u2019ve never seen before. To one side of the room, a human female is sprawled face down in a pool of blood. She is dressed like a high-ranking member of the Cult of the Dragon.</blockquote><br>The dead cultist was slain by Iskander. They argued, the dead cultist turned to step onto the teleport circle, and Iskander stabbed her before stepping through the teleporter himself. <br><br>A character who inspects the body and makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check can tell that the cultist was killed by a <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTI2ZDViOTYzYzU0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>dragontooth dagger</a></em>.<br><br>The balconies are set 8 feet above the floor and can be easily reached by climbing. The floor of each balcony is a teleport circle similar to those found throughout the tower. The controls are located beneath the railing of the balcony, and can be found with a DC 8 Intelligence (Investigation) check. These controls can take characters only back to the main circle in this area.<br><br>The decorations in the room are reminiscent of a Maztican style of architecture. Xonthal studied the culture of Maztica extensively and incorporated many Maztican motifs into his home. <hr><h3>9. Closed Chambers</h3>What use Xonthal put these rooms to is unknown. Empty when the cultists arrived, they were quickly repurposed as barracks. Bedrolls scattered about show that between four and six cultists use each room.<br><br>The teleporter on this level is located inside a circular chamber with a closed door. The door and the walls of the room are made of thin, unpolished steel. The door swings outward if a simple latch is turned. <br><br>When the characters arrive, one <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDZkMDkwM2MzOWEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cult fanatic</a></strong> and four <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzU5NWJiODNhNjY5 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>cultists</strong></a><strong> </strong>are searching the floor for Iskander. The cultists quickly realize they can\u2019t defeat the adventurers, and they make a dash for the teleport room. They try to escape to the lounge (area 11), where they expect to find reinforcements.<hr><h3>10. Shrine</h3>When Xonthal lived in the tower, this shrine was dedicated to Oghma. The cult traditionalists turned this chamber into a laboratory for their studies.<br><br><blockquote>Painted renditions of dracoliches line the walls of this chamber, and a stone altar in the center of the area features the skeletal limbs and claws of a dragon. A half-dozen cultists look up in surprise at your appearance.</blockquote><br>The skeletal forelimbs of a black dragon have been mounted to the altar and enchanted with a permanent <em>animate objects</em> spell. When the characters enter, it won\u2019t be apparent that the limbs are connected to the altar or that they can be animated. Each limb has AC 10 and 50 hit points and can make one melee attack per round at a creature within 5 feet of it: +4 to hit; 6 (1d10 + 1) piercing damage.<br><br>The room is occupied by two <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjljM2ZhMDgwYzQ2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>mages</strong></a><strong> </strong>and five <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDZkMDkwM2MzOWEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cult fanatics</a></strong> who attack at the first sign of intruders. As an action, one of the mages screams the command word to activate the skeletal dragon limbs. If the cultist who activated the limbs is killed, the limbs stop attacking, but both mages know the command word. The cultists all fight to the death. <br><br>This room contains many notes and scrolls about dracoliches but nothing of value.<hr><h3>11. Lounge</h3>This chamber was Xonthal\u2019s combination living room, office, and den, used for studying, relaxing, and writing. When they took over the tower, the cultists turned this chamber into another dracolich laboratory. <br><br><blockquote>A large fireplace in the center of the room keeps this chamber warm and cozy, its smoke magically vented outside. About two-thirds of the skeleton of an adult dragon is laid out on the floor, curled around the fireplace. Before you have time for further assessment, however, a half-dozen black-cloaked figures move to attack you.</blockquote><br>The six <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDZkMDkwM2MzOWEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i><strong>cult fanatics</strong></a><strong> </strong>in this room move in as soon as anyone appears in the teleporter. If they can, the cultists try to reach the teleport circle and activate it while one or more characters are still on it. The teleport circle takes only a few seconds to activate, so characters standing in the circle won\u2019t be able to move away unless they have the ability to move as a reaction. The cultists select the shrine level as the adventurers\u2019 destination.<br><br>When the characters have time to examine the skeleton (a black dragon), they can see that the bones are disconnected and placed roughly, and that the creature\u2019s forelimbs are missing. They also see signs that the cultists do their cooking here, finding a collection of simple dishware stacked along the north wall, along with sacks containing potatoes, turnips, jerky, and flour.<br><br>Aside from the lovingly cleaned skeleton and notes that a scholar might find interesting, this level holds nothing of value.<hr><h3>12. Observatory</h3>Jorgen Pawl (<strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjljM2ZhMDgwYzQ2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>mage</a></strong>) and 3 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDZkMDkwM2MzOWEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>cult fanatics</a></strong> are outside this chamber on the balcony when the characters teleport in. All four wait to ambush the first character who steps onto the balcony. If the characters explore the observatory before investigating the balcony, the cultists rush into the room, hoping to attack with surprise.<br><br><blockquote>This chamber is clearly the workplace of a wizard. A pair of voluminous tomes on astronomy and astrology lie open on a table. A massive telescope of brass, crystal, and polished mahogany rests on an intricate stand in the middle of the chamber. A ladder rests against one wall, and an immense crystal lens is embedded in the ceiling.</blockquote><br>Xonthal used this chamber for making observations of the starry sky. The ladder is for reaching the ceiling-mounted lens, which looks upward from the tower. Little can be seen through it during daytime, but at night, the lens gives the telescope a view of the entire sky from horizon to horizon.<br><br>Jorgen Pawl has the hourglass-shaped key that allows access to the dungeon level of the tower. Touching the key to the hourglass symbol on any teleport circle control panel activates the circle for a jump to the teleport circle in area 14.<hr><h3>13. Bedroom</h3>Jorgen Pawl and Iskander share this presently empty chamber, which might have been luxurious before being subjected to the ravages of time. A table assembled from planks laid across barrels is covered in notes and scrolls, all pertaining to dracoliches and having no bearing on the current crisis. <br></section>", "img": "modules/mod-rise-of-tiamat/journal/007_-_Episode_7_3A_Xonathal_27s_Tower/004_-_The_Tower/avatar.png"}

The secrets and ancient guardians of this area remain a mystery to them. Xonthal performed most of his experiments here, and the dungeons once included numerous extradimensional spaces accessible from the main corridor (area 17). <br><br>When the first two groups of cultists sent down here to explore were killed by the elementals in area 15, Jorgen Pawl quickly declared the dungeon off limits. Iskander understood the risks of fleeing here, but he knew it was the one place where Jorgen\u2019s fanatical followers would be reluctant to pursue him. <hr><h3>General Features</h3><strong><em>Ceilings</em></strong>. Chambers in the dungeon have 10-foot-high ceilings unless otherwise noted.<br><br><strong><em>Light</em></strong>. Unless otherwise noted in the area description, areas 14 to 23 are unlit until a creature steps into the room. Magic lamps then activate and provide bright light.<br><br><strong><em>Sound</em></strong>. Sound carries well through these rooms and corridors. The sound of fighting or other loud noises in one area can be heard through a closed door in an adjacent area. <hr><h3>14. Dungeon Teleporter</h3>The bodies of three dead cultists lie on the floor here. A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check determines that two of them were killed by bolts of magical force (Iskander\u2019s handiwork). No check is needed to see that the third was stabbed to death. A trail of blood runs into this room from area 15.<br><br>Iskander was waiting in this chamber for pursuers to appear. He killed two immediately but the third chased him into area 15, where the elementals attacked both of them.<br><br>The teleporter here can reach any teleport circle in the tower above, but its controls do not allow characters to return to the sundial.<hr><h3>15. Elemental Checkpoint</h3><blockquote>Blood streaks the floor here, including the smeared trail leading back to the teleport chamber and a second trail of bloody boot prints heading up the corridor to the north. Standing amid the gore are three humanoid figures\u2014two that look like misshapen statues of clay and stone and one appearing as a humanoid made of flame. </blockquote><br>The creatures are 2 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGY1NDUwOTAzMTA0 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>earth elementals</a></strong> and a<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTZlYTI5YmI5NzAx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>fire elemental</a></strong> Xonthal called forth to guard his workshops. In the absence of new orders, the elementals eternally follow Xonthal\u2019s last command to slay intruders. When any character enters the room, the elementals attack. They fight until destroyed, or until the party flees back to area 14 or moves further into the dungeon. The elementals do not pursue outside this area unless attacked from a distance.<br><br>A large, round table with four chairs sits in one corner of the room, with shelves and workbenches arranged along the walls. Books and papers are scattered on the table, along with a locked wooden chest about the size of a shoebox. Opening the lock requires thieves\u2019 tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A failed check sets off a magic<em> glyph of warding</em> trap that triggers a slow spell affecting all creatures in the area except elementals. Creatures affected by the spell can attempt the saving throw again at the end of each of their turns. Otherwise, the effect ends after 1 minute. <br><br>The chest contains three scrolls: two<em> scrolls of protection against fire elementals</em> and one <em>scroll of protection against earth elementals</em>. Characters who claim these scrolls can use them to move safely past the elementals, if they bunch tightly together to keep everyone inside the effect\u2019s five-foot radius from the caster. With only one <em>scroll of protection against earth elementals</em>, characters will probably be forced to deal with the earth elementals at least once. <br><br>The writing on the papers and books in the room has become illegible, and the paper is so brittle from the fire elementals\u2019 heat that it crumbles at a touch.<hr><h3>16. Laboratory</h3><blockquote>It\u2019s obvious at a glance that this area was once a wizard\u2019s workroom. Worktables are covered with notes, alchemical flasks, beakers, braziers, and other arcane apparatus. More startling is the whirlwind occupying the center of the room. Ten feet across and stretching from floor to ceiling, it swirls endlessly, revealing a number of sparkling gems within it.</blockquote><br>The whirlwind is not a creature, but one of Xonthal\u2019s experiments. The gemstones swirling inside it are <em>elemental gems</em>. If a hand or any other material object is pushed into the whirlwind, it disrupts the perfect balance of the airflow, causing an <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=YzJjMjM3OWZiNDdh ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>elemental gem</a></em> to spin out and smash on the floor, summoning an angry <strong>elemental</strong>. You can choose the elemental\u2019s type or determine it randomly. The whirlwind contains eight gems, two of each elemental type. Every time the whirlwind is disturbed, another gem is ejected and breaks.<br><br>The equipment here is now useless, and any reagents or components have long since dried up, decayed, or lost their potency. A character who spends a day poring over the notes can attempt a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check to understand that Xonthal was involved in a complex attempt to create elementals that fused the best traits of earth, air, fire, and water.<hr><h3>17. Cosmic Hallway</h3><blockquote>Steps descend to a walkway that appears to stretch across infinite space. Thousands of stars twinkle in unfamiliar constellations, and meteors streak through the vastness above and below the path. Just past the base of the stairs, a door framed by nothingness rises from the path. Fifty feet beyond that, the path meets an intersection, with another door straight ahead. </blockquote><br>This corridor is a relic of Xonthal\u2019s experimentation with extradimensional space. The path is formed by the floor of the corridor, which is perfectly solid and secure despite appearing to extend into the void. Reaching beyond the edge of the walkway confirms the absence of walls or ceiling. The atmosphere is thin and cold, but not uncomfortably so. <br><br>At an opportune moment when one or more characters are moving along the path, a swarm of tiny meteors shoots past, threatening to knock them off the walkway. All creatures on the path must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to dodge the meteors. On a failed save, a creature is struck, takes 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage, and is knocked off the walkway.<br><br>A creature knocked off the walkway appears to fall into infinite space. Unless the creature can fly or teleport back to the walkway, it quickly vanishes from sight. Roll 1d4 + 17; the number rolled is the number of the room where the character materializes and crashes to the floor on the following round, taking 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall.<br><br>Though having a character fall off the walkway is dangerous (and potentially exciting), it makes it less likely that the adventurers can be tricked by the efreeti in area 22.<hr><h3>18. Study</h3><blockquote>This circular room is obviously a library or study, its walls lined with bookshelves that extend from the floor to the gently domed ceiling twenty feet overhead. A wheeled ladder is connected to a rail that runs around the curved wall, allowing access to the upper shelves. A delicate, ornate desk stands at the center of the room, surrounded by piles of blank paper. A large map sits on the desk, its corners held down with stones.</blockquote><br>The two secret doors in this area are concealed behind swinging bookshelves, and can each be found with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The door to the spellbook study (area 20) is opened by shifting a book at floor level. The door to the observation room (area 19) is located 10 feet above the floor. It is opened by positioning the rolling ladder in front of the door and pushing on the shelf 15 feet above the floor. <br><br>If anyone but Xonthal opens either secret door, the papers piled throughout the room begin to ruffle as though a breeze blows through the area. Thousands of sheets of heavy paper then fly into the air in a great whirlwind, slashing at any creature in the area. One distinct storm of paper forms around each character on the first round. Every round after that, two more cyclones form, to a maximum of three per character.<br><br>Treat these<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDIzYzQxMzYyZWMx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>paper whirlwinds</a></strong> as <strong>swarms of ravens</strong>, but they are constructs instead of beasts, and they have vulnerability to fire. When the paper swarms form, they remain on guard in the study for 30 minutes, then collapse to piles of paper once more. They won\u2019t pursue characters into the hallway, but will chase them into the two adjoining rooms. <br><br><h4>Treasure</h4>The contents of Xonthal\u2019s library are as valuable as they are voluminous. The wizard\u2019s collection includes nearly five thousand books, pamphlets, folios, quartos, scrolls, and tablets with a combined weight of more than a ton. The entire collection would be worth 50,000 gp if it could be moved. Alternatively, the characters can pick out a few especially valuable volumes. <br><br>A character trained in one of the following skills can make a check to search the library for a work on that subject: Animal Handling, Athletics, Arcana, History, Medicine, Nature, Performance, Persuasion, Religion, or Sleight of Hand. Multiply the total of the check by 10 to get the gp value of the single most valuable book a character can find on that subject. Each skill check takes 10 minutes, but many characters can be searching at the same time. Characters who search for more books take a cumulative \u201310 penalty to subsequent checks.<br><br>The map shows the region of the Elemental Plane of Fire surrounding the fabled City of Brass. The map cannot be harmed by fire, and is worth 500 gp to a planar scholar or explorer.<hr><h3>19. Observation Room</h3>The floor of this room is 10 feet higher than the floor of area 18. <br><br><blockquote>A circular pane of crystal ten feet in diameter hangs vertically in this chamber, anchored to the ceiling, walls, and floor by chains. A scene of roiling fire can be glimpsed within the crystal. In front of the crystal, an ornate rod is set into the floor.</blockquote><br>The scrying crystal allowed Xonthal to peer into other planes, and is currently set to view the Elemental Plane of Fire. The view is controlled by the rod set into the floor, and moving it shifts the scene. Doing so properly is challenging, however. A character can attempt a DC 20 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to move the rod. Success indicates that the crystal displays a brief glimpse of a stunning fiery vista near the City of Brass. Failure indicates that the crystal shows only flames.<hr><h3>20. Spellbook Study</h3><blockquote>A large, simple desk with several ink pots, quill pens, and a single chair occupy the center of this otherwise empty room. </blockquote><br>Xonthal used this room for writing his spellbooks, but those books went with him when he vanished. The ink pots are dried up, but any character trained in Arcana will recognize the specific type of ink used for magical writing. The quill pens are exquisitely fashioned and still usable. <hr><h3>21. Storage Closet</h3>This area is lined with shelves holding hundreds of mundane and exotic reagents and components used by Xonthal in his experiments. Most of the supplies have evaporated, congealed, or decayed over long years, but any spellcasting characters can find enough useable materials here to replenish their material components if necessary. <hr><h3>22. Taraz the Fair</h3>Where the hallway bends to the northeast, it once again takes on the appearance of a stone corridor.<br><br><blockquote>Light shines out ahead as the corridor opens into a room set with comfortable-looking oversized furnishings. In the center of the room, a red-skinned creature wearing armor of flame, bronze, and volcanic stone sits cross-legged on the floor, studying a chessboard.</blockquote><br>The creature is an <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YTMyOTI0N2QxYzli ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>efreeti</a> </strong>named Taraz the Fair. The name has nothing to do with his sense of justice or fair play, however, but refers to the light hues of his fiery hair. Xonthal trapped Taraz and was trying to bend or trick the efreeti into service when he disappeared. The trapped creature has had over a century of solitude to rue its fate.<br><br>Taraz is held in this area by a thin line of magical salt. Imbued with potent wards by Xonthal, the salt rings the bases of all four walls and extends across the doorway in the joints between paving stones. A character with a passive Perception of 18 or higher notices the salt automatically. Otherwise, a character who looks carefully spots the salt with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana or Investigation) check. <br><br>Taraz greets the adventurers with a fiery smile. He assumes correctly that the characters\u2019 arrival so soon after Iskander\u2019s appearance is no coincidence, and he uses the missing mage as leverage for negotiating. Taraz\u2019s only concern is escape, and he will do anything to win his freedom. <br><br>Taraz\u2019s conversation with the adventurers covers the following points\u2014many of which are utter lies designed to help him gain the characters\u2019 trust:<br><br><ul><li>Xonthal stripped Taraz\u2019s power to grant wishes when he trapped the efreeti here, to prevent him from escaping. He will recover his power only when he is freed. (Both false.)</li><li>Xonthal warded the chamber to prevent the efreeti from harming anyone, so that the wizard and the genie could play chess. Xonthal promised to set Taraz free if he ever won a match. (False on all counts. Xonthal never entered this area, because Taraz can and will harm creatures in his chamber.)</li><li>The characters are perfectly safe in the corridor. (True, as long as Taraz is confined to area 22.) </li><li>Taraz has no desire to harm the characters, and couldn\u2019t even if he wanted to, thanks to Xonthal\u2019s protective magic. (False. Xonthal\u2019s wards confine the efreeti and its magic to area 22, but they don\u2019t protect other creatures in that area.)</li><li>Taraz saw a human (Iskander) come down the corridor ahead of the adventurers. He was carrying a mask that resembled a dragon\u2019s face, and he looked badly wounded. (All true.)</li><li>Iskander stumbled and fell off the walkway with the mask into the infinite space beyond, where he undoubtedly is still falling. To rescue him and recover the mask, the characters will need Taraz\u2019s help, for the only way to get the mask back from the cosmic well around the walkway is with a wish. The efreeti will bestow this powerful magic on the party in exchange for his freedom. (False on all counts, including the efreeti\u2019s ability to bestow a wish.)</li><li>Freeing Taraz is as simple as breaking the line of salt across the entryway. (True.)</li></ul>In the end, Taraz is desperate to escape the dungeon, and he will promise almost anything\u2014short of continued servitude\u2014to win his freedom. Unless the terms of the deal are ironclad, however, the efreeti will seek a way to weasel out of any bargain once he is free, and to attack the characters out of sheer malice. Because he can fly, Taraz has no fear of falling off the walkway, and he will push characters off it.<br><hr><h3>23. Time Chamber</h3><blockquote>Two massive hourglasses occupy this irregularly shaped chamber. Their glass globes are nearly fifteen feet across, with each hourglass rising almost to the ceiling thirty feet overhead. Each is suspended by chains, pulleys, and gears in such a way that it can be turned over to set its sand running. <br><br>Slumped against the wall at the far side of the chamber is the cultist who called to you from the balcony of the tower. His dark robes are charred and torn, and a blue dragon mask is clutched in his red-stained hands. </blockquote><br>In addition to his mastery of spatial magic, Xonthal dabbled in the manipulation of time. These hourglasses were part of his attempt to control the flow of time, though he abandoned that research. The hourglasses can be rotated by pulling on their chains, but the only effect is a hideous, ear-grating groan. The sand runs, but but the hourglasses\u2019 magic has long since dissipated.<br><br>Casting a<em> detect magic</em> spell reveals faint auras of transmutation magic within the sand of each hourglass. An hourglass has AC 5, 25 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning and thunder damage. An hourglass that drops to 0 hit points shatters, spilling its sand onto the floor. Sifting through the pile reveals 1d4 + 2 tiny diamonds amid the grains of sand. Each diamond has an apparent value of 100 gp, and a character in possession of a diamond can use a bonus action to teleport to a space it can see up to 30 feet away, whereupon the diamond disappears.<br><br><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YmIxNzY0YjIyZjEz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Iskander</a> has been dead since shortly after he arrived here, slain by the wounds inflicted by the elementals.

As soon as he understood that the traitorous <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YmIxNzY0YjIyZjEz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Iskander</a> was somehow in league with the adventurers, he used <em>sending </em>to call an <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YjJmMTQxODVjZjUy ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>adult blue dragon</a> </strong>from its nearby lair, telling it of Iskander\u2019s theft of the dragon mask.<br><br>When the characters teleport to the sundial, they are greeted by the terrible sound of villagers screaming, a dragon roaring, and lightning bolts tearing houses to splinters. When they reach the edge of the garden, they see the dragon swooping over the village and terrified villagers fleeing in every direction. A character with passive Perception of 14 or higher recognizes this dragon as Lennithon, the adult blue dragon the party faced in the <em>Hoard of the Dragon Queen</em>. <br><br>Like any smart foe, Lennithon tries to fight on its terms, not the enemy\u2019s. It stays in the air and uses its breath weapon to maximum effect. If the characters refuse to face it, Lennithon is happy to wreck the village and murder innocents in an effort to bring the heroes into the open.<br><br>When the characters face the dragon, read or paraphrase the following.<br><br><blockquote>\u201cThe mask, fools! The mask is what I\u2019ve come for. Give it to me, and I\u2019ll leave these crawling ants with their miserable lives. The Queen is returning! Who are you to hope to stop her? Give me the mask!\u201d</blockquote><br>This dragon is loyal to the cult, but it has no intention of getting killed before Tiamat\u2019s glorious return. It fights until it is reduced to 75 hit points, then flies away to recuperate. <br></section>", "img": ""}

At the meeting, they learn that the council has been approached by a Red Wizard of Thay named Nyh Ilmichh. Ilmichh has extended an invitation to the council to send an envoy to Thay, to discuss ways in which Thay and the Sword Coast might aid each other during the current crisis. The adventurers have been specifically requested to represent the Sword Coast at this meeting, after which the characters will be returned to Waterdeep unharmed. <br><br>The visit to the embassy will last only a few days, but the location of the meeting is not negotiable. The duties of the tharchion (a Thayan governor) the characters will meet precludes her leaving her post. The characters\u2019 council contact tells them that Ilmichh has been carefully questioned and subjected to a <em>zone of truth</em>, and that all she said has been confirmed. <br><br>The characters should understand that without the Red Wizards, Severin\u2019s plans are severely compromised. Moreover, it is common knowledge that Szass Tam wants all exiled Red Wizards dead in the worst possible way. Despite reservations from some on the council, most believe that since the factions and Szass Tam have a common goal, the invitation is worth accepting.<br><br>The final decision is up to the characters, of course. No one will compel them to go to Thay. But in the council\u2019s estimation, the potential to delay or even undo Severin\u2019s plan at a single blow is too much to pass up. <br><br><h3>A Dark and Forbidding Land</h3>Thay is an isolated and arid windswept plateau some twenty-five hundred miles east of Waterdeep, its dark skies constantly clouded by volcanic ash. This land is defined by the prevalence of undead within its borders. The supreme leader of Thay is the lich Szass Tam, whose council of advisers\u2014the zulkirs\u2014are powerful liches themselves. Everyone of consequence in Thay is a spellcaster, and necromancers are common there. Undead servants are everywhere, and many of the commanders in Thay\u2019s armies are the free-thinking undead soldiers (use the <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzY4ZmViZjYxMDdi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wight</a></strong> statistics).<br><br>Travelers to this land must be wary of its dark politics\u2014rampant paranoia, a police-state mentality, and necromancers commanding the top of the social order\u2014as much as the threats of the undead and Red Wizards that dwell here. Thay is a place filled with extraordinary danger.<br><br><h3>Preparations and Departure</h3>The Harpers keep a close watch on developments in Thay, and they are the characters\u2019 best resource for current information on that land. If the characters don\u2019t seek advice from the Harpers, Leosin Erlanthar approaches them. <br><br>In addition to providing the characters with the information about Thay above, Erlanthar arranges for them to receive sealed warrants indicating that they are acting on behalf of the Lords of Waterdeep and the Lords\u2019 Alliance. The party is under the protection of both groups, though such warrants are no guarantee of safety in Thay. Erlanthar advises the characters to address anyone of importance deferentially and by title, never by name only. As well, characters who know any necromantic magic should feel free to show it off.<br><br>When the adventurers are ready to depart, Nyh Ilmichh teleports with them to Nethwatch Keep in the Tharch of Lapendrar, just inside the Thayan frontier. <br><br><h3>Reception and Audience</h3>Nethwatch Keep is under the command of Tharchion Eseldra Yeth. She has been tharchion of Lapendrar for nearly a century\u2014long enough to have firsthand memories of the past rebellion. <br><br>At the fortress, the characters are assigned to luxurious individual rooms, though the doors have no locks. Nyh Ilmichh tells anyone who asks that they are utterly safe in the tharchion\u2019s keep. The adventurers see no other living creatures until their audience with Eseldra Yeth. All the servants and staff are undead, but the food and comforts of the fortress are of excellent quality and entirely safe.<br><br>Tharchion Eseldra Yeth is a female human <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NWE3ODRlOTQ3NWI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>vampire spellcaster</a></strong>. In the audience chamber where the meeting takes place, she is accompanied by 10 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2VkMDk5ZmY0M2U2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Red Wizards</a></strong> and 5 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzY4ZmViZjYxMDdi ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>wights</a></strong>. Eseldra Yeth reviews the characters\u2019 warrants briefly, then delivers a prepared message.<br><br><blockquote>\u201cWe find ourselves bound in common cause against common enemies. Those who sought to destroy us in ages past now seek to destroy you. Our thirst for vengeance is strong, as is your thirst for continued life.<br><br>\u201cOur enemy has become your enemy. We know their weaknesses and the ways of destroying them forever, without destroying their usefulness. You have the opportunity to discover their hiding places in your struggle against their cult allies. Together, we can remove them as a threat to us both.<br><br>\u201cOur agent, Nyh Ilmichh, will return with you to your city of Waterdeep, there to serve as our liaison to your council. What you learn of the enemy, she will relay to us by means of our own. You need only find the enemy. We will deal with them, as is our custom.<br><br>\u201cI am authorized by our eternal master, Szass Tam, to say these things, for I act in his name.\u201d</blockquote><br>The tharchion waits for the characters\u2019 response, and engages them in a discussion of what is known of the plot to release Tiamat and the Red Wizards aiding that plot. Her questions are straightforward and intelligent, and offer little opportunity for sly or clever responses. If a character is less than truthful, Eseldra Yeth probes for more information. She addresses questions to specific characters, never to the group in general. If she detects a lie (see below), she never addresses that character again. <br><br>Toward the end of the audience, each character must make a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check. (To maintain an aura of menace, ask for the check without revealing the DC.) The following modifiers apply to the check:<br><ul><li>Arcane spellcasters gain a +6 bonus.</li><li>Characters who openly worship a deity associated with death gain a +4 bonus.</li><li>Clerics and paladins of good-aligned deities take a \u20136 penalty.</li><li>Other characters wearing visible signs of worshiping any good-aligned deity take a \u20134 penalty.</li><li>A character takes a \u20134 penalty each time he or she addresses Eseldra Yeth without using her title of tharchion.</li><li>Any character who lies to Eseldra Yeth takes a \u20138 penalty, unless he or she succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma (Deception) check for each lie. (Don\u2019t reveal the DC of this check.)</li></ul>Feel free to introduce additional modifiers based on specific arguments the characters present and their overall behavior. Sincere (or at least convincing) praise for necromancy and for Thay\u2019s twisted social order might earn a +2 or +4 bonus. Insincere praise, obvious hollow flattery, or outright hostility should invoke a penalty. <br><br>Make note of which characters succeed at the saving throw and which fail. The outcome determines what happens to them that night. <br><br>At the end of the audience, the characters are dismissed. Before being returned to their rooms and fed a sumptuous evening meal, Nyh Ilmichh tells them they will meet again in the morning. <br><br><h3>Dreams and Nightmares</h3>That night, each of the adventurers are targeted by a customized version of the dream spell, cast and crafted by Red Wizard illusionists. Each character is confronted in a vision by a pale Red Wizard who says, \u201cWe have further questions for you.\u201d Elves and other creatures that do not sleep are not subject to this effect.<br><br>Each character must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage. On a successful save, a character remembers vague, disturbing dreams in the morning, but suffers no other effects. <br><br>Each character who fails the saving throw experiences a similar nightmare. He or she is paralyzed and magically bound within a mystic cauldron among animated chains and tentacles. A dozen Red Wizards observe placidly while three more Red Wizards subject the helpless character to agonizing tortures. The character is questioned about why the party came to Thay, about Severin\u2019s plots, about Rath Modar, about his or her own past and the lives of the other adventurers, about the party\u2019s attitude toward Szass Tam, and anything else you care to ask.<br><br>Each answer the character gives must be accompanied by a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check if the character answers truthfully, or a DC 15 Charisma (Deception) check if the response is even partially false. A character who succeeded on the Charisma (Persuasion) check made during the audience has advantage on each of these checks. On each failed check, a character suffers excruciating pain as a Red Wizard shouts out a tally of the character\u2019s failed answers. Refusing to answer is treated the same as failing the check. <br><br>A character who struggles against the bonds or who tries to cast a spell or use some other ability not hindered by physical restraint is struck by pain so severe that he or she is briefly incapacitated. That character\u2019s next Charisma check made within the dream takes a \u20132 penalty.<br><br>The nightmare ends when a character answers five questions successfully or eight questions in total. If the last question was answered successfully, the character sleeps fitfully the rest of the night. If the last question was answered unsuccessfully, the character wakes up screaming and drenched in sweat. Blood stains the bed sheets, though the character has no visible wounds. The character also takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage and does not gain the benefit of a long rest from the night\u2019s sleep.<br><br>In the morning, any character who underwent this questioning has a deathly pallor and dark, hollow-looking eyes. The character\u2019s appearance returns to normal when he or she finishes a long rest. <br><br><h3>Outcome</h3>In the morning, after another delicious meal, the characters are ushered back to the audience chamber. Eseldra Yeth is not there. Instead, they\u2019re greeted by Nyh Ilmichh and one of the Red Wizards present at the audience the previous day. Only Nyh Ilmichh speaks.<br><br>What she says is determined by the number of characters who answered five questions successfully during the dream. If that number accounts for more than half the non-elven party (that is, elves don\u2019t count toward the party total, because they cannot be affected by the Red Wizards <em>dream</em> spell), Nyh Ilmichh informs the characters that the Red Wizards have agreed to aid the factions of the Sword Coast, and that she will accompany them as Thay\u2019s ambassador to the council. When the characters have gathered their belongings, the Red Wizard teleports with them back to Waterdeep.<br><br>If the tally is half the number of non-elven characters in the party or fewer, Nyh Ilmichh states that Tharchion Yeth thanks them for their information, but that Thay\u2019s attention is commanded by matters within its own borders and the Red Wizards cannot help. Before the characters can react, the other Red Wizard waves his hand and a previously invisible magic circle on the floor around the characters flares to life. A moment later, the adventurers are standing in an abandoned and ruined farmhouse a mile north of Waterdeep. The barely visible outline of a Thayan teleportation circle fades around them and their neatly packed belongings.<br></section>", "img": ""}

As they do, the adventurers take on the crucial assignment of infiltrating the temple and making a final stand against the servants of the Dragon Queen and their dark goddess.<br><br>The climactic finale of <em>The Rise of Tiamat </em>should be played only after all the other episodes of the adventure are complete and the characters have reached 14th or 15th level. In the episodes leading up to this one, both the Harpers and the Zhentarim have spies among the Cult of the Dragon. As such, both organizations can report that the cult\u2019s preparations are nearing completion. That same information could also come from prisoners questioned directly by the characters during any of the incidents in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MDcxYWYxNDdlZTgy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Cult Strikes Back</a>.<br><br>However it happens, from the moment this episode kicks into action, events escalate rapidly. There is no turning back from that point onward, and characters who hesitate risk losing everything.<hr><h3>The Final Battle</h3>The battle between the factions of the Sword Coast and the Cult of the Dragon plays out as a huge clash between armies and monstrous forces. The manner in which that battle plays out depends on the outcome of the <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=OTNlYzRlYzc3MmI2 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Fourth Session</a> of the Council of Waterdeep episode, and on how successful the heroes have been bringing the various factions together.

When Severin\u2019s plan swings into its final stage, the <em>Draakhorn\u2019s </em>call shifts from being barely perceptible to a clear and distant sound that gives a sense of impending doom to all who hear it.<br><br>See area 8 in <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NDFiYWZiMzgzMGZm ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Well of Dragons</a> for more information on the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NjM1NWY5NDNhOTlk ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Draakhorn</a></em>.<hr><h3>Severin\u2019s Triumph</h3>Severin\u2019s plan to bring Tiamat back to the world has been set up in five distinct stages:<br><ol><li>Assemble a treasure hoard worthy of Tiamat.</li><li>Gather an army of dragons and other evil creatures to defend the Well of Dragons against interference.</li><li>Capture hundreds of prisoners whose souls will power the magic that draws Tiamat to Faer\u00fbn.</li><li>Perform the ritual that raises Tiamat\u2019s Temple in the caldera of the Well of Dragons.</li><li>Sacrifice the prisoners while performing the ritual that guides Tiamat from the Nine Hells to the world.</li></ol>The first three stages of Severin\u2019s plan are complete. Stage 4 will be completed by the time the characters arrive at the Well of Dragons. Stage 5 begins soon after the heroes and their factional allies arrive, and becomes the focal point of this final battle against the cult.<hr><h3>Stopping Severin</h3>The heroes\u2019 goal is to thwart Severin\u2019s plans and prevent Tiamat from passing from the Nine Hells into Faer\u00fbn. The characters\u2019 accomplishments up to this point have frustrated Severin and slowed his plans. But the only thing that can truly stop him now is ending the ritual performed by the cult\u2019s Red Wizard allies inside the Temple of Tiamat.<hr><h3>Approaching the Well</h3>As the characters and the forces commanded by the factions of the Council of Waterdeep approach the Well of Dragons, they should have no doubt that they are moving deep into enemy territory. The landscape for a hundred miles in all directions is a grim harbinger of what Tiamat\u2019s rule would mean for the world.<br><br><blockquote>Little remains in the territory surrounding the Well of Dragons, and the constant drone of the <em>Draakhorn </em>has forced the local animals to flee or driven them mad. A handful of villages in the area are bloodstained ghost towns, and every farmstead is a charred ruin. The few survivors you encounter are headed in the opposite direction, all of them watching the sky for the telltale shape of a dragon on the wing.</blockquote>Chromatic dragons patrol the area by day and night. You can call for DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) checks to determine whether the characters find shelter or camouflage themselves in time to avoid a passing dragon. Alternatively, simply ask what precautions the characters are taking against being spotted and judge for yourself whether that will keep them safe. Sticking to wooded areas, following ravines, spending as little time as possible on open ground, and even dressing as cultists are all useful ploys.<br><br>Flying to the Well of Dragons is problematic. Whether they\u2019re on metallic dragons or flying under their own power, the characters will be attacked by chromatic dragons long before they reach their destination. <br></section>", "img": "modules/mod-rise-of-tiamat/journal/009_-_Episode_9_3A_Tiamat_27s_Return/000_-_Introduction_to_Episode_9/avatar.png"}

For reasons no mortal understands, many dragons reaching the end of their lives come to the Well of Dragons to die, and have been doing so for millennia.<br><br><blockquote>The caldera of a long-dead volcano rises from an ashen plane ahead. Along the cinder cone\u2019s steeply sloped sides, thousands of creatures mill about or are lining up into ordered infantry ranks. In the air above, dozens of chromatic dragons wheel and shriek like a flock of immense crows, awaiting the bloodshed of the battle to come.</blockquote><br>The Cult of the Dragon discovered the Well of Dragons long ago. Lava tubes snaking beneath the now-dormant volcano formed natural corridors connecting caverns that the cult enlarged for their own use. Within the central caldera, they raised a ritual space for creating dracoliches from dragons drawn to the site knowing they would soon die. Under Severin\u2019s leadership, the caldera and the catacombs beneath it have been repurposed as the site where Tiamat\u2019s vast temple will be raised and the Dragon Queen\u2019s new reign begun. The floor of the caldera is blanketed with the bones of dragons, mounded into immense, tangled heaps.<br><br>The caldera of the Well of Dragons is roughly oval-shaped, with high, steep walls. The dragons flying above it are not scouting for infiltrators, thankfully, but are quarreling and posturing for each other before the battle. <br><br>In the past, the number of cultists at the Well of Dragons seldom exceeded one hundred. Now, with ultimate victory near at hand, their numbers have swelled. Only cultists live and work in the warrens beneath the caldera. The thousands of mercenaries, giants, devils, and monsters serving the cult are camped chiefly along the north and east slopes. <hr><h3>The Temple of Tiamat</h3>The map of the caldera shows the outline of where the Temple of Tiamat will appear when it is raised by the Red Wizards\u2019 magic. That job will be finished by the time the characters and their allies arrive to do battle with the cult. For information about the interior, see <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzU3YWExYzY5OWY1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Tiamat's Temple</a><br><br><blockquote>The caldera is blanketed beneath the bones of hundreds of dead dragons, but that\u2019s not its most arresting feature. A mind-numbing structure has pushed up from beneath the tangled bones to tower above the blasted volcano. Partly volcanic ash fused with dragon bones and partly stone imbued with the dark magic of the Nine Hells, the Temple of Tiamat is all chaotic angles and jutting buttresses. Within that snarl of cornices and soaring angulation, you make out five asymmetric towers topped by twisted steeples.</blockquote><hr><h3>Lava Tubes and Warrens</h3>Lava tubes form natural pathways beneath the caldera of the extinct volcano. Over the decades since the Cult of the Dragon claimed the Well of Dragons, cultists enlarged the natural caverns connected by the lava tubes and excavated new ones. <br><br>Most of the lava tube entrances are marked by visible paths along the slopes of the volcano. Entrance 2A sees little use, so the characters are likely to overlook it without a careful search. Entrance 3 is never used; the cult believes that this tunnel is still blocked after a collapse sixty years before.<hr><h3>General Features</h3><strong><em>Corridors</em></strong>. The lava tubes range from 15 to 25 feet in diameter. They are large enough for dracoliches and dragons to move through easily. <br><br><strong><em>Light</em></strong>. The lava tube corridors are dimly lit by lamps or torches hung on the walls at wide intervals. Chambers within the Well of Dragons are brightly lit by lamps unless otherwise noted. <br><br><strong><em>Sound</em></strong>. The low moan of the <em>Draakhorn </em>is ever-present within the Well of Dragons, originating from area 8. Combined with the cult\u2019s activity in and above the caverns, it creates a constant thrum of background noise transmitted through the stone. Sounds of combat go unnoticed if a fight is over in 3 rounds or fewer, or if the combat is more than 200 feet away from creatures that might hear it. Especially loud noises, such as a <em>thunderwave </em>spell, are easily heard. <hr><h3>Within the Well of Dragons</h3>As the time for the ritual draws near, the Well of Dragons is crawling with cultists and their allies. Whether using stealth or disguising themselves as cultists, the characters can easily survey the entrances to the lava tubes or see the risen temple from the edge of the caldera. However, once the adventurers enter the Well of Dragons, disguises prove ineffective. The cultists working in and patrolling the caverns are on high alert, and use a complex system of checks and passwords as proof against spies and enemy agents.<br><br>The advanced state of the ritual means that all cultists have been ordered to patrol or prepare for battle. If the characters tarry too long in one place or wander around the Well of Dragons without purpose, add additional guard patrols based on existing encounters. <hr><h3>1A, 1B, 1C. North Entrances</h3>Entrance 1A sees the heaviest use of all the tunnel entrances along the north side of the caldera. All the treasure brought to the Well of Dragons passes through it on the way to area 6 or area 7. Each of these entrances is guarded by 3 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTMyYjE3ZWZmNzcw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonwings</a></strong>, 3 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGUyYThmZWVlODkz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonclaws</a></strong>, and 2 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTNjMzg3OWVkODNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guard drakes</a></strong>. <br><br>Entrances 1B and 1C are within sight of each other, but 1A is hidden from the other two by the curve of the mountainside.<hr><h3>2A, 2B, 2C. East Entrances</h3>Of the tunnel entrances on the east side of the caldera, only 2C is heavily used. All the prisoners held in the warrens are brought through that tunnel on their way to areas 16, 17, or 18. Entrance 2A is seldom used. Entrance 2B is used by the cultists who live in areas 12 and 13, but by no one else. <br><br>Entrances 2A and 2B are guarded by 1 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTMyYjE3ZWZmNzcw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonwing</a></strong><strong> </strong>and 3 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGUyYThmZWVlODkz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonclaws</a></strong><strong> </strong>each. Entrance 2C is guarded by 1 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmJkZTc1MWIwZDUx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonfang</a></strong>, 3 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTMyYjE3ZWZmNzcw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonwings</a></strong>, 5 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGUyYThmZWVlODkz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonclaws</a></strong>, and 3 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTNjMzg3OWVkODNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guard drakes</a></strong>.<br><hr><h3>3. Forgotten Entrance</h3>No cultist has used this entrance since the tunnel collapsed at the three-way intersection sixty years ago, rendering the passageway useless. Recently, an umber hulk burrowed by accident into these tunnels, reopening the passage in all three directions. As a result, this tunnel offers an unguarded entrance into the caldera and the warrens.<br><br>A character who scouts the mountain before charging in notices this entrance with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check. Any exploration of the entrance reveals that it is used by bats but shows no sign of cult activity.<br><br>A thin wall of rubble still standing to the east of the three-way intersection makes the cultists believe the passage remains completely blocked. However, the wall can be carefully taken down to allow movement in that direction. Characters at the three-way intersection can feel air moving along the northern part of the tunnel, suggesting open space beyond. <hr><h3>4. Naergoth Bladelord\u2019s Chamber</h3>Before Severin assumed control over the Cult of the Dragon, the Well of Dragons was used to transform dying dragons into dracoliches. <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODVjYjVjZTIzNjE3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Naergoth Bladelord</a></strong> is a wight who commanded this site for centuries in the name of the Cult of the Dragon. After devoting many lifetimes of selfless service to the cult, he was shunted aside in favor of the new order. Though his loyalty remains unshakeable, Naergoth fears that Severin will succeed in his plans, and that Tiamat will destroy the cult that freed her.<br><br>As a wight, Naergoth has little use for quarters, but the presence of objects that belonged to him in life make this a pleasing spot for him. The chamber looks like the home of a noble knight that was abandoned centuries ago, its contents now covered in dust and hung with cobwebs and pathos. <br><br>Intruders skulking through the warrens can run into Naergoth anywhere. Use him as a roleplaying encounter or add him to a battle that is going well for the party at a time of your choosing. <hr><h3>5. Unused Chamber</h3>Whatever purpose this empty chamber served during the years of the dracoliches is long forgotten. <hr><h3>6. Main Treasure Chamber</h3>The well-traveled entrance to this chamber is guarded by 1 <strong><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmJkZTc1MWIwZDUx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonfang</a> </strong></strong>who is in command of 2 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MDQwOWY1MDg5OGM1 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>flesh golems</a></strong>.<br><br>The treasure that the cult has stolen from across the Sword Coast to create a hoard for the Dragon Queen is stockpiled in this chamber, creating a sight beyond even the greediest character\u2019s dreams.<br><br><blockquote>You see gold\u2014mountains of it. And jewels . . . and pearls . . . silver plate and gilded mirrors . . . jeweled swords and the armor of kings . . . caskets and boxes and barrels filled to overflowing with the treasure of the Sword Coast, packed into a cave the size of a cathedral and stacked to the height of a giant! Pathways wind through a glittering mass whose reflected light dazzles your eyes, like a million twinkling stars close enough to touch.</blockquote><br>Prowling through the narrow paths between the heaped treasures are 4 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTNjMzg3OWVkODNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guard drakes</a></strong>. They are used to the vaults being unoccupied (rank-and-file cultists are not allowed here), and attack intruders or move to join fighting at the entrance at once.<br><br>This cavern holds treasure beyond counting. If the characters seek a particular item and have hours to spend searching, they can probably find it here. A <em>detect magic</em> spell is blocked by the metal of the coins, so only items on the surface can be easily found. Place whatever common or uncommon magic items you wish on the surface, but finding something rare should take a long and noisy search. <hr><h3>7. Secondary Treasure Chamber</h3>Art objects, valuable books, fine linen, crystalware, and especially fragile magic items are stored here less haphazardly than in area 6, piled carefully on shelves and tables.<hr><h3>8. The Draakhorn</h3>As the characters advance up the lava tube toward this chamber, the tones of the <em>Draakhorn </em>become noticeably louder. Within 50 feet of the entrance to area 8, the air begins to shimmer from the sound. Any character within 20 feet of the doorway must succeed on a DC 12 Strength check to continue pushing against the pressure of the sound. A failure indicates the character can advance no farther toward area 8. <br><br>For any character entering area 8, the sound fades to silence\u2014because any creature that enters the chamber is temporarily deafened and must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. Success indicates the deafness ends 2 minutes after the <em>Draakhorn </em>ceases to sound. Failure indicates the character remains deafened for 1 hour after the <em>Draakhorn </em>ceases to sound. <br><br><blockquote>After the din of the tunnel, this chamber seems preternaturally silent\u2014until you realize you are completely deafened in the presence of the fearsome Draakhorn. Carved from the massive horn of an ancient red dragon, it hangs suspended by chains from the ceiling of this chamber, blasted with fire to a dark ebony hue and bound by thick bands of bronze. Draconic runes etched into its surface glow with a purple eldritch fire.</blockquote><br>An<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjYxYWY0MzIyYTI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>air elemental</a> </strong>sounds the horn with its endless breath, guarded by a<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZDljYjc5NzYwMDZm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>stone golem</a></strong>. If the characters interfere with the horn or the air elemental, the golem and the elemental attack.<br><br>The <em>Draakhorn </em>hangs in the northern half of the room and is pointed toward the southwest corner. While the horn is sounding, a creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw the first time on a turn the creature enters a 150-foot cone in front of the horn or starts its turn there. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn\u2019t knocked prone. The horn can\u2019t be turned or aimed at a specific target.<br><br>If the horn\u2019s sound ceases for more than 1 minute, 1 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OGUxMmJjYTlhNWI4 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonsoul</a></strong>, 1 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmJkZTc1MWIwZDUx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonfang</a></strong>, and 4<strong> </strong><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTMyYjE3ZWZmNzcw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonwings</a></strong><strong> </strong>arrive to investigate.<hr><h3>9. Planning Room</h3>In this currently empty chamber, Severin meets with his inner circle and other cult leaders to make plans and issue orders. A long table is flanked by several benches and chairs, with a few small writing tables along the walls for scribes who keep notes.<hr><h3>10. Leaders\u2019 Quarters</h3>This well-appointed dormitory houses the most important Wearers of Purple staying at the Well of Dragons. Rows of beds line the north and east walls, with locker-style wardrobes holding mundane gear along the west wall. As the activity at the Well of Dragons reaches its peak, this chamber is empty.<hr><h3>11. Severin\u2019s Quarters</h3>This chamber is the personal quarters of Severin, and contains a bed, a trunk holding mundane personal belongings, a wardrobe for robes and regalia, a large writing desk, and a wood-and-iron display stand for the dragon masks. The stand\u2019s construction allows for the masks to be displayed separately or combined into the single <em>Mask of the Dragon Queen</em>. The combined mask is presently with Severin.<hr><h3>12, 13. High-Ranking Cultists\u2019 Chambers</h3>Cultists of dragonsoul and dragonfang rank stationed inside the warrens use these quarters. The chambers are arranged like barracks, with cots for sleeping and trunks for storing personal belongings. With so many strangers presently in and around the Well of Dragons, the cultists who use these chambers have arranged for 4 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTNjMzg3OWVkODNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guard drakes</a></strong> to watch the area.<hr><h3>14. Prisoners\u2019 Effects</h3>Personal items taken from prisoners are tossed into this chamber. Nothing of value can be found among the odds and ends, but daggers, darts, and shortswords here can be used to equip prisoners still capable of fighting.<hr><h3>15. Low-Ranking Cultists\u2019 Chamber</h3>The cultists who stand guard over the prisoners in areas 16 to 18 sleep here. The chamber contains only straw mattresses spread on the floor, a few tables made of planks laid over barrels, and roughly made benches. When the characters enter, the room contains 3 <strong><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTMyYjE3ZWZmNzcw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonwings</a> </strong></strong>and 9 <strong><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGUyYThmZWVlODkz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonclaws</a> </strong></strong>eating a quick meal before the battle.<hr><h3>16, 17, 18. Prisoner Pens</h3>Prisoners captured by the cult have been held in these dark, filthy chambers pending the day of the ritual and their eventual sacrifice. Two groups of guards patrol these areas while the prisoners are here, each consisting of 1 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MTMyYjE3ZWZmNzcw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonwing</a></strong>, 2 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGUyYThmZWVlODkz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonclaws</a></strong>, and 1 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTNjMzg3OWVkODNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guard drake</a></strong>.<br><br>If the characters pass this way while the sacrifices are taking place, area 16 is empty except for a dozen corpses of prisoners who died of starvation. However, a half-starved fifteen-year-old human male named Stirleng is hiding within the corpses. Stirleng can tell the characters that cultists started ushering prisoners toward the caldera a few hours ago, but he knows little else.<br><br>With area 16 empty, a prisoner escort consisting of 5 <strong><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGUyYThmZWVlODkz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonclaws</a> </strong></strong>has begun to move prisoners from area 17 up to the temple. Additionally, a <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=MmJkZTc1MWIwZDUx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonfang</a></strong>, 5 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZGUyYThmZWVlODkz ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>dragonclaws</a></strong>, and 2 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTNjMzg3OWVkODNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guard drakes</a></strong> working nearby arrive within 2 rounds if a disturbance breaks out. The prisoners aren\u2019t shackled or roped together, but most of them are weak from starvation. Ten human<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=NzI1MzM2ZTc3ZTE3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>commoners</a> </strong>can fight alongside the characters if they can acquire weapons. The characters are free to make use of these allies any way they see fit, but will be aware that if sent into combat, they will quickly perish.<hr><h3>19. Drake Pens</h3>The drakes that patrol the lava tunnels are kenneled in this chamber, which reeks of blood and spoiled meat. When the characters investigate this chamber, 4 <strong><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTNjMzg3OWVkODNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guard drakes</a></strong> </strong>are present, fighting over hunks of meat that are best left unidentified. Gnawed humanoid bones are scattered throughout the room, along with belt buckles, tattered boots, and scraps of blood-soaked clothing.<hr><h3>20, 21. Red Wizards\u2019 Quarters</h3>The Red Wizards whose magic raises the Temple of Tiamat in the caldera and who will perform the ritual that draws the Dragon Queen into the world are housed in these two caverns. Both areas are luxuriously furnished, but the Red Wizards keep their belongings packed in trunks and ready to teleport away at a moment\u2019s notice. The larger and even more well-appointed area 20 is the residence of <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzIxODNiZjM2MWIx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rath Modar</a>. All the Red Wizards are presently in the Temple of Tiamat.<hr><h3>22. Sinkhole</h3>This portion of the caldera collapsed into an underground cavity ages ago to form a large sinkhole. The only current member of the Cult of the Dragon who is aware that a branch of a lava tunnel exits into this sinkhole is the wight <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ODVjYjVjZTIzNjE3 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Naergoth Bladelord</a> (area 4), and he believes the tunnel is still blocked.<br><br>The sinkhole is 30 feet deep. The sides are steep but composed of rough volcanic rock that\u2019s easy to climb. Dragon bones cover the bottom of the pit to a depth of 5 feet, making the floor of the pit difficult terrain. Cultists never come to the sinkhole; the only creatures that might spot infiltrators in this area are flying dragons.<hr><h3>23. Northern Exits</h3>The dragon bones that blanket the caldera have been pushed away from these exits to create a bleak open plaza connecting both tunnel exits to the entrance to the temple. This space extends 250 feet from east to west and 100 feet north from the temple gate, and is the scene of horrendous slaughter during the sacrifice ritual. Prisoners are ushered from the temple into the plaza, where five waiting dragons (one of each color, and of any age category you choose) tear into them with teeth and claws.<br><br>Though these exits are not normally guarded, during the prisoner sacrifice, the each tunnel is blocked by 2<strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=M2FiNjQ1NWE4NmEw ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>barbed devils</a></strong> and 4 <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=OTNjMzg3OWVkODNk ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>guard drakes</a></strong>. The devils\u2019 attention is focused toward the plaza, however, not down the tunnels or on what the guard drakes do. The guard drakes might notice approaching characters before the devils do, but they attack only if the fiends give the order. Therefore, the party might get the drop on these guards.<br><br>For characters who move beyond the cleared plaza, or who approach this area from the sinkhole, the piles of bones are difficult terrain.<hr><h3>24. Temple Exit</h3>The main lava tunnel of the southern warrens exits inside the black chapel (area 5) of Tiamat\u2019s temple. Prisoners intended for sacrifice are brought up to the black chapel, marched to the temple entrance, and forced out into the plaza for the waiting dragons to feast on. This exit is unguarded. <br></section>", "img": "modules/mod-rise-of-tiamat/journal/009_-_Episode_9_3A_Tiamat_27s_Return/001_-_The_Well_of_Dragons/avatar.png"}

The Red Wizards\u2019 ritual has brought it here to act as a beachhead and beacon for the Dragon Queen, melding it into the caldera floor in the process. The main gate into area 1 (the blue chapel) is the only apparent entrance, but a lava tube corridor from the cult\u2019s subterranean warrens leads into area 5 (the black chapel). <br><br>When the ritual begins, the temple is the focus of the cult\u2019s activity, with Severin\u2019s Red Wizard allies at the center of the action. The souls of sacrificed prisoners are sent to Avernus to provide the magical power that will open a pathway between the Nine Hells and the Material Plane. The Red Wizards will then guide Tiamat as the Queen of Dragons claws her way back into the mortal realm. <hr><h3>Temple Layout</h3>The interior of the temple is a single open expanse. Though divided into distinct areas, the cathedral-like space has no interior walls or upper floors. Five chapels are devoted to one of the five aspects of Tiamat and the matching branch of chromatic dragons, all surrounding a central apse. The apse and all five chapels rise into separate spires, culminating in the sanctuary at the pinnacle of the central spire. Level 2 as shown on the map is a zone 50 feet above ground level; level 3 is a zone 100 feet above ground level, both of which can be reached only by flying. <br><br><blockquote>Once your eyes adjust to the stunning chaos of Tiamat\u2019s Temple, you see that its interior is a single, cathedral-like space that towers far overhead. Five distinct vaults branch off the central gallery. Though the overwhelming color of the place is a lifeless, ashen gray, each of the side vaults shimmers dimly blue, green, red, white, or black\u2014the hues of the evil dragons and their world-consuming queen. <br><br>Red Wizards stand in each of the five vaults, chanting and channeling magical force into the central apse. There, a kaleidoscopic whorl of arcane energy rises above the blackened floor, stretching up into the twisting recesses of the temple\u2019s central spire. </blockquote><br>The numbered areas on the map are identified in the table below, which also identifies key NPCs during the ritual that will bring Tiamat to the Well of Dragons. <br><br><h4>Key to Tiamat\u2019s Temple</h4><table><thead><tr><td>#</td><td>Name</td><td>Occupant and Activity during Ritual</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Entrance/blue chapel</td><td>Red Wizard performing ritual</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Least apse</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>White chapel</td><td>Red Wizard performing ritual</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Green chapel</td><td>Red Wizard performing ritual</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Black chapel</td><td>Red Wizard performing ritual; also the exit from the warrens</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Red chapel</td><td>Rath Modar performing ritual</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Great apse</td><td>Portal through which Tiamat emerges from Avernus<br></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Blue spire</td><td>Red Wizard (flying) performing ritual</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>White spire</td><td>Red Wizard (flying) performing ritual</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Green spire</td><td>Red Wizard (flying) performing ritual</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Black spire</td><td>Red Wizard (flying) performing ritual</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Red spire</td><td>Red Wizard (flying) performing ritual</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Sanctuary</td><td>Severin (levitating) wearing the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2IyZjNmNTc3NTYw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Mask of the Dragon Queen</a></em></td></tr></tbody></table>Any free wyrmspeakers the characters have previously interacted with can be present in their respective chapels in the temple if you wish, but their presence isn\u2019t required. Wyrmspeakers not here are outside leading the Well of Dragons\u2019 defense.<hr><h3>Performing the Ritual</h3>To successfully bring Tiamat from the Nine Hells into the world, the Red Wizards must successfully focus the summoning ritual for 10 rounds after the adventurers enter the Temple of Tiamat. Each round, at least five Red Wizards must use an action to perform the ritual in order for it to be successfully focused for that round, helping guide Tiamat across the planes.<br><br>At the end of the Red Wizards\u2019 turn, if fewer than five Red Wizards used an action to perform the ritual, the portal floating in the great apse (area 7) wavers and no progress in the ritual is made. If fewer than five Red Wizards perform the ritual for 2 rounds in succession, the portal collapses and the count of successfully focused rounds is reset to 0.<br><br>The <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2IyZjNmNTc3NTYw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Mask of the Dragon Queen</a></em> is essential to the ritual, and Severin cannot leave the sanctuary. His levitate spell will last the duration of the ritual, and it keeps him floating in the sanctuary even if he is incapacitated or killed. Severin can attack and defend himself while he wears the <em>Mask of the Dragon Queen</em>. He need not even be alive for the ritual to continue, as long as his body wears the mask and remains in the sanctuary. <br></section>", "img": "modules/mod-rise-of-tiamat/journal/009_-_Episode_9_3A_Tiamat_27s_Return/002_-_Tiamat_27s_Temple/avatar.png"}

The alliances forged by the characters during the adventure are essential to stopping the cult. <br><br>The Final Battle Assets table lists the creatures and forces fighting on both sides. \u201cFactional Assets\u201d covers the main possibilities for alliances created during the adventure, but you can modify the list as needed depending on events in your campaign.<hr><h3>Assigning Assets</h3>When you\u2019ve noted which assets are fighting against the cult, it\u2019s time to decide how those forces of good attack. The characters are key figures in the allied force marching on the Well of Dragons, and their voices carry tremendous weight. As such, make sure the players know they have a key role to play in planning the battle.<br><br>The simplest approach is a one-to-one matchup, with specific good assets canceling out cult assets. Give the players free reign on matching assets, but weigh in on whether a specific plan has merit if you feel the need. For example, the players might decide that assassins provided by the Zhentarim should counter the sacrificial prisoners by infiltrating the cult complex and escorting those prisoners to freedom. In that case, you might remind the players that the Black Network\u2019s expert killers can be put to better use against the cult leaders of Severin\u2019s inner circle, while Harper agents or forces of the Lords\u2019 Alliance help in the tunnels beneath the caldera.<br><br>Certain matchups are obvious. The metallic dragons are instinctive foes of the chromatic dragons, and those two forces can be expected to keep each other occupied during the battle. More importantly, the metallic dragons will keep the chromatic dragons from interfering with the adventurers\u2019 plans. <br><br><h4>Final Battle Assets</h4><table><thead><tr><td>Cult Assets</td><td>Factional Assets</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Severin</td><td>Order of the Gauntlet</td></tr><tr><td>Rath Modar</td><td>Emerald Enclave</td></tr><tr><td>Cult leaders*</td><td>Zhentarim assassins</td></tr><tr><td>Cultist troops</td><td>Harper agents</td></tr><tr><td>Chromatic dragons</td><td>Metallic dragons</td></tr><tr><td>Devils</td><td>Devils</td></tr><tr><td>Giants</td><td>Giants</td></tr><tr><td>Evil mercenaries</td><td>Lords\u2019 Alliance army</td></tr><tr><td>Temple of Tiamat</td><td>Skyreach Castle**</td></tr><tr><td>Red Wizards</td><td>Arcane Brotherhood</td></tr><tr><td><em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2IyZjNmNTc3NTYw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Mask of the Dragon Queen</a></em></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>* Including any free wyrmspeakers the adventurers have interacted with.<br>** If it survived the previous adventure and remains in control of the player characters or was returned to the giants.<br><br><h4>Cult Assets</h4><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjAxNjhjN2VmZGVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Severin</a></strong>. The head of the cult remains in the temple sanctuary (area 13 <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzU3YWExYzY5OWY1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Tiamat's Temple</a>), wearing the <em>Mask of the Dragon Queen </em>while the Red Wizards weave their magic. He can fight defensively or offensively as needed, and rank-and-file cultists fight to the death as long as they know Severin is alive.<br><br><strong><em>Rath Modar.</em></strong> <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=YzIxODNiZjM2MWIx ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Rath Modar</a> leads the ritual of guidance, but any <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2VkMDk5ZmY0M2U2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Red Wizard</a> can take on that role. When the temple is attacked, he hands over his part in the ritual and leads the attack against the adventurers.<br><br><strong><em>Cult Leaders.</em></strong> Wearers of Purple are venerated leaders among the cultists, and most of them are powerful combatants in their own right.<br><br><em><strong>Cultist Troops. </strong></em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=MTRhOTg1ODUwZWM0 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Cult of the Dragon</a> has thousands of combatants at the Well of Dragons, all armed and dedicated to the glory of the Dragon Queen.<br><br><strong><em>Chromatic Dragons.</em></strong> The exact number of chromatic dragons present at the Well of Dragons is up to you, and could range from a few dozen to a hundred or more.<br><br><strong><em>Devils.</em></strong> Devils fighting for the cult have been summoned by the Red Wizards, and serve fiendish masters dedicated to seeing Tiamat leave Avernus.<br><br><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Mzc3ZjIwNzk3ZTgy ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Giants</a></strong>. The few giants who fight for the cult believe that Tiamat\u2019s return is inevitable, but they are sullen and uncooperative. They fight when they see easy victory but withdraw when they sense defeat.<br><br><strong><em>Evil Mercenaries.</em></strong> Mercenary companies form the backbone of the cult\u2019s army. Better trained than the cultists, these mercenaries are capable of standing against the best warriors in Faer\u00fbn.<br><br><strong><em>Temple of Tiamat.</em></strong> The temple is necessary as the site of the ritual. Damaging it can help weaken Tiamat if the ritual is successful.<br><br><strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=N2VkMDk5ZmY0M2U2 ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Red Wizards</a></strong>. Red Wizards not performing the ritual are embedded with mercenary units and troops of armed cultists to provide extra firepower.<br><br><em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2IyZjNmNTc3NTYw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Mask of the Dragon Queen</a></em>. The magic of the mask is central to the ritual\u2019s success. If it is claimed or destroyed, the ritual fails, but Severin uses all the power of the mask to keep it in his possession. <br><br><h4>Factional Assets</h4><strong><em>Order of the Gauntlet.</em></strong> Troops of the Order of the Gauntlet are among the toughest, most steadfast soldiers on the Sword Coast. Besides serving in their own units, their leadership bolsters other troops.<br><br><strong><em>Emerald Enclave.</em></strong> Druids and rangers of the Emerald Enclave answer the call to arms by bringing their treant and griffon allies from the forests and mountains of the Sword Coast. <br><br><strong><em>Zhentarim Assassins</em></strong>. These silent killers stalk and kill enemy leaders and messengers. Though only a handful of Zhentarim assassins have joined the fight, they can paralyze an enemy unit at a decisive moment or prevent a crucial order from reaching its destination.<br><br><strong><em>Harper Agents.</em></strong> Intercepting intelligence during battle is a Harper specialty, and Harper agents can provide key information about cult plans and deployments. As well, Harper archers, infantry, and spellcasters can have an enormous impact on the battle.<br><br><strong><em>Metallic Dragons.</em></strong> The metallic dragons will be outnumbered by their chromatic cousins. However, they cooperate with allies better than the evil dragons do, giving them a greater impact on the battlefield.<br><br><strong><em>Devils</em></strong>. Certain powerful devils don\u2019t want to see Tiamat unleashed on Faer\u00fbn, knowing that their own power will be curtailed in a world in which humanoids no longer rule. Agents of the Nine Hells are ferocious fighters, but their presence in the battle makes many other soldiers uneasy.<br><br><strong>Giants</strong>. If the factions of Waterdeep secured the allegiance of giants, they delight in squaring off against the chromatic dragons. Trouble might arise between giants and metallic dragons, however, if the two contingents aren\u2019t given assignments of equal importance and kept apart.<br><br><strong><em>Lords\u2019 Alliance Army.</em></strong> The massed forces of the separate members of the Lord\u2019s Alliance are second only to the Order of the Gauntlet in fighting power, and far more numerous. These form the backbone of the attacking force.<br><br><strong><em>Skyreach Castle.</em></strong> If it\u2019s available, the flying castle could prove a great boon in the battle. Skyreach will be assaulted by chromatic dragons the moment it appears above the Well of Dragons, drawing those powerful combatants away from defending the caldera.<br><br><strong><em>Arcane Brotherhood.</em></strong> Members of the Arcane Brotherhood are a match for the Red Wizards fighting for the cult. However, the spellcasters of the Arcane Brotherhood don\u2019t take orders from anyone except other powerful spellcasters\u2014which almost certainly means another member of the Arcane Brotherhood.<hr><h3>Thwarting the Dragon Queen</h3>The process of bringing back Tiamat involves four key components\u2014the treasure amassed by the cult, the <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2IyZjNmNTc3NTYw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Mask of the Dragon Queen</a></em>, the sacrifice of prisoners, and the ritual that is the culmination of all Severin\u2019s mad plans. The crashing or capture of Skyreach Castle has already set back the cult in its goal of collecting suitable treasure for the Dragon Queen, making the other three stages of the process that much more important. <br><br>The mask, the sacrifices, and the ritual can all be targeted by the characters. Doing so effectively might actually end the ritual and prevent the appearance of Tiamat. Even if the heroes cannot manage to end the threat before it begins, however, disrupting any part of the ritual process weakens the Dragon Queen. <hr><h3>Facing Tiamat</h3>When the forces of good have been deployed and the battle begun, the characters will take on the most important goal of assaulting the Temple of Tiamat. Making their way through the caverns beneath the caldera provides a number of options for reaching the temple.<br><br>Whether the characters fight Tiamat directly or prevent the summoning ritual from being completed depends on their actions during the final battle. But when the characters see Tiamat\u2019s heads forcing their way through the Red Wizards\u2019 portal, they will understand that this is no mere monster they face. As should be clear from her statistics, <strong><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZTY0ZTk2ODQ2Yjdm ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Tiamat</a></strong><strong> </strong>is a god. If she manifests through the portal at full strength, she can demolish multiple 15th-level parties with ease. A huge battle against Tiamat while her temple collapses to ash and bone is a memorable way to wrap up a campaign\u2014but the characters might not survive as anything more than memories.<br><br>During the battle in the temple, read the following text aloud after 10 rounds of the summoning ritual have been successfully focused by five or more Red Wizards.<br><br><blockquote>The magical maelstrom filling the central apse of the temple suddenly splits open with a crack of thunder. The gargantuan heads of five dragons begin to tear and gnash their way out of the rune-lined pit of fire that forms there. Tiamat the Dragon Queen is about to burst bodily from her confinement in the Nine Hells and enter the world</blockquote><br><h4>Tiamat\u2019s Appearance</h4>Tiamat\u2019s heads enter the battle starting on the second round after the ritual is completed, in the following order: white, black, green, blue, and red. Her red head announces the Dragon Queen\u2019s full appearance in the sixth round after the ritual is completed. Until that round, Tiamat can make use only of her bite attacks and breath weapons. This gives the characters a last chance to try to weaken the Dragon Queen before she appears. <br><br>Once Tiamat appears in full, she spends as many rounds as necessary to laughingly devour her hapless servants five at a time\u2014Rath Modar, any remaining Red Wizards, then <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=Actor data-id=ZjAxNjhjN2VmZGVl ><i class=\"fas fa-user\"></i>Severin</a> (or his corpse, as long as it is wearing the<em> Mask of the Dragon Queen</em>). The following round, she turns her wrath on the adventurers.<hr><h3>Weakening the Dragon Queen</h3>The actions of the heroes in and prior to this final battle can reduce Tiamat\u2019s power before she appears. Make a note if any of the following events occurs:<br><br><ul><li>The count of rounds over which the ritual is successfully focused is reset to 0 because the ritual is interrupted for two successive rounds.</li><li>The <em><a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Y2IyZjNmNTc3NTYw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Mask of the Dragon Queen</a></em> is destroyed, or is removed from Severin\u2019s body and taken from the temple sanctuary (<a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=NzU3YWExYzY5OWY1 ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>area 13</a>). </li><li>The characters hold any of the dragon masks, or can otherwise prevent one or more masks from being used in the ritual. (The <em>Black Dragon Mask </em>might have been claimed by the characters in the previous adventure.)</li><li>Severe damage is inflicted to the Temple of Tiamat, as from an <em>earthquake </em>spell.</li><li>The sacrifice of prisoners in front of the temple is stopped. This might have been previously accomplished by attacking the dragons or by cutting off the flow of prisoners to the area.</li></ul>When any of the previous events occurs, the following penalties are applied to Tiamat, in this order:<br><br><ul><li>Tiamat\u2019s attack and breath weapon damage is reduced by 15, and her hit points drop by 75. </li><li>Tiamat loses her Regeneration trait, her hit point maximum is reduced by 75, and her immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons becomes resistance instead.</li><li>Tiamat loses Limited Spell Immunity, and her hit point maximum is reduced by 75.</li><li>Tiamat takes a \u20135 penalty to attack rolls, saving throw DCs, and to her AC, and her hit point maximum is reduced by 75.</li><li>Tiamat can take only three legendary actions, and her hit point maximum is reduced by 75.</li></ul>If all the above penalties are successfully applied, Tiamat is effectively reduced to a challenge rating 18 foe\u2014but that\u2019s still a deadly fight for four 15th-level characters. Without all five reductions, the characters stand little chance of surviving a battle against the Dragon Queen, much less winning it. <br><br><strong><em>Banishing Tiamat</em></strong>. If the characters reduce Tiamat to 0 hit points, her Discorporation trait kicks in. The portal collapses as the shrieking Dragon Queen disintegrates and is dragged back to Avernus. She will remain trapped there until someone else can recreate the conditions of the ritual and try again to free her.<br><br><strong><em>Ruthless Play and High Stakes</em></strong>. Except as noted above, Tiamat should not be arbitrarily weakened in the interest of a fair fight. Presenting the Dragon Queen as anything less than a deity undercuts the whole adventure. Characters who tangle with Tiamat must know that they are in the fight of their lives. <br><br>No individual\u2019s survival matters against the goal of stopping the Dragon Queen\u2019s return, and heroes sometimes die for the greater good. Certainly, fallen characters can be raised again if Tiamat is defeated. And if she\u2019s not defeated, dying might not be the worst option.<br></section>", "img": ""}

With Tiamat ascendant, the age of mortals comes to an end and the age of dragons begins. Nations and kingdoms shatter, civilization collapses into bloody war, and chaos reigns supreme. <br><br>None of the Dragon Queen\u2019s mortal agents receive the rewards they expected. The Red Wizards who freed her are devoured or driven away, hunted by the forces of Szass Tam. The cultists who orchestrated Tiamat\u2019s return fare little better, with the Dragon Queen not caring which mortals her draconic subjects hunt, consume, and enslave. The glorious reign of dragons that Severin hoped to usher in and rule becomes a brutal world where evil dragons dominate all. <br><br>Such dark times need not mean the end of your campaign, however. The characters have lost a crucial battle, but they might survive to continue the war. Their new goal is to find a way to banish or destroy Tiamat for good, bringing peace to the world once more.<hr><h3>Aftermath of Victory</h3>Tiamat\u2019s threat ends if she is sent back to the Nine Hells, but the aftermath of victory can create challenges the adventurers must deal with. This includes helping the hundreds of prisoners remaining in the Well of Dragons. Severin\u2019s fall also leaves hundreds of unrepentant cultists still loose in the world, hungering for power and revenge in light of their recent failure. <br><br>Moreover, much of the wealth of the Sword Coast is sitting in the Well of Dragons. Along with dealing with vengeful cultists, the characters might take a lead role in getting the treasure back to its original owners or their next of kin, while dealing with con artists, thieves, and treasure hunters looking to exploit what has suddenly become the richest dungeon in Faer\u00fbn.<br><br>Among the cult\u2019s former allies, the vindictive chromatic dragons scatter back to their lairs, but only after many of them try to claim choice pieces of treasure or barrels bulging with gold and gems from the cult\u2019s hoard. Furious at having their queen vanquished, the chromatic dragons might engage in sprees of destruction not seen in Faer\u00fbn for centuries.<br><br>Even victorious, the armies of good will have paid a steep cost in the fight against Tiamat. In addition to soldiers, leaders representing the ruling nobility of countless regions and houses will have fallen in the fight. The situation is not all bleak, however. Stirring instances of generosity and cooperation will stand out amid the darkness\u2014and none of those will be greater than the legend of the adventurers. For generations, folk will look to the exploits and sacrifices of the heroes for inspiration as they rebuild and set their sights on better days.<br></section>", "img": ""}

Successfully completing an episode of the adventure will usually gain support from multiple factions. However, each faction has its own priorities, and sometimes a heroic deed that pleases one faction can anger or disappoint another. In some cases, a faction might even prefer that the characters engage in antiheroic acts\u2014by executing certain enemies rather than taking prisoners, for example. The adventurers might also be seen to be favoring certain factions, if metallic dragon allies are sent to defend the interests and settlements of one faction over another.<br><br>Each faction has its own column on the scorecard. Important events that occur during The Rise of Tiamat are noted along the side of the scorecard, beginning with events that could have occurred in the previous adventure, Hoard of the Dragon Queen. If you didn\u2019t play Hoard of the Dragon Queen, assume that events marked with an asterisk (*) occurred and that other events did not.<br><br>A plus sign (+) for a particular faction and event indicates that the faction approves of the successful outcome of that event, and that the characters gain respect for that outcome. Each + counts as +1 in the final tally. A negative icon (\u2212) indicates that a faction disapproves of an outcome and the characters lose respect for it. Each \u2212 counts as \u22121 in the final tally. A blank means that the faction either doesn\u2019t consider the event significant or that there\u2019s no consensus within the faction. Some events are especially important to certain factions, and are marked double plus (+/+) or double minus (\u2212/\u2212).

These are the decisions about which factions receive metallic dragon guardians, which factions had to make concessions to secure the metallic dragons\u2019 aid, and who takes possession of Xonthal\u2019s Tower. Only the factions that are affected have their icons marked. For example, if King Melandrach and Ulder Ravengard had to make concessions to win the support of the metallic dragons, only their entries on that line should be circled or highlighted.<br><br>Some attendees are easier to sway toward pledging their full support, including Dagult Neverember.

Once you have the details figured out, use this section to adjust the difficulty of the encounter.<br><br><h4>Combat Encounter Difficulty</h4>There are four categories of encounter difficulty.<br>\n<br><strong><em>Easy.</em></strong> An easy encounter doesn't tax the characters' resources or put them in serious peril. They might lose a few hit points, but victory is pretty much guaranteed.<br>\n<br><strong><em>Medium.</em></strong> A medium encounter usually has one or two scary moments for the players, but the characters should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or more of them might need to use healing resources.<br>\n<br><strong><em>Hard</em></strong>. A hard encounter could go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken out of the fight, and there's a slim chance that one or more<br>\ncharacters might die. <br><br><strong><em>Deadly.</em></strong> A deadly encounter could be lethal for one or more player characters. Survival often requires good tactics and quick thinking, and the party risks defeat.<br><br><h5>XP Thresholds and Encounter Difficulty by Character Level</h5><table><thead><tr><td>Character Level</td><td>Easy</td><td>Medium</td><td>Hard</td><td>Deadly</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>25</td><td>50</td><td>75</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>50</td><td>100</td><td>150</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>75</td><td>150</td><td>225</td><td>400</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>125</td><td>250</td><td>375</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>250</td><td>500</td><td>750</td><td>1,100</td></tr><tr><td>6th<br></td><td>300</td><td>600</td><td>900</td><td>1,400</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>350</td><td>750</td><td>1,100</td><td>1,700</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>450</td><td>900</td><td>1,400</td><td>2,100</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>550</td><td>1,100</td><td>1,600</td><td>2,400</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>600</td><td>1,200</td><td>1,900</td><td>2,800</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>800</td><td>1,600</td><td>2,400</td><td>3,600</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>1,000</td><td>2,000</td><td>3,000</td><td>4,500</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>1,100</td><td>2,200</td><td>3,400</td><td>5,100</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>1,250</td><td>2,500</td><td>3,800</td><td>5,700</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>1,400</td><td>2,800</td><td>4,300</td><td>6,400</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>1,600</td><td>3,200</td><td>4,800</td><td>7,200</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>2,000</td><td>3,900</td><td>5,900</td><td>8,800</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>2,100</td><td>4,200</td><td>6,300</td><td>9,500</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>2,400</td><td>4,900</td><td>7,300</td><td>10,900</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>2,800</td><td>5,700</td><td>8,500</td><td>12,700</td></tr></tbody></table><br><h4>Evaluating Encounter Difficulty</h4>Use the following method to gauge the difficulty of any combat encounter.<br><br><strong><em>\n1. Determine XP Thresholds.</em></strong> First, determine the experience point (XP) thresholds for each character in the party. The XP Thresholds by Character Level table below has four XP thresholds for each character level, one for each category of encounter difficulty. Use a character's level to determine his or her XP thresholds. Repeat this process for every character in the party.<br>\n<br><strong><em>2. Determine the Party's XP Threshold. </em></strong>For each category of encounter difficulty, add up the characters' XP thresholds. This determines the party's XP threshold. You'll end up with four totals, one for each category of encounter difficulty.<br><br>For example, if your party includes three 3rd-level characters and one 2nd-level character, the party's totaled XP thresholds would be as follows:<br><br><strong>Easy: </strong>275 XP (75 + 75 + 75 + 50)<br><strong>\nMedium:</strong> 550 XP (150 + 150 + 150 + l 00)<br><strong>\nHard: </strong>825 XP (225 + 225 + 225 + 150)<br><strong>\nDeadly: </strong>l ,400 XP (400 + 400 + 400 + 200)<br>\n<br>Record the totals, because you can use them for every encounter in your adventure.<br><br><strong><em>\n3. Total the Monsters' XP.</em></strong> Add up the XP for all of the monsters in the encounter. Every monster has an XP value in its stat block.<br><br><strong><em>\n4. Modify Total XP for Multiple Monsters.</em></strong> If the encounter includes more than one monster, apply a multiplier to the monsters' total XP. The more monsters there are, the more attack rolls you're making against the characters in a given round, and the more dangerous the encounter becomes. To correctly gauge an encounter's difficulty, multiply the total XP of all the monsters in the encounter by the value given in the Encounter Multipliers table.<br><br>\nFor example, if an encounter includes four monsters worth a total of 500 XP, you would multiply the total XP of the monsters by 2, for an adjusted value of 1,000 XP. This adjusted value is not what the monsters are worth in terms of XP; the adjusted value's only purpose is to help you accurately assess the encounter's difficulty.<br>\n<br>When making this calculation, don't count any monsters whose challenge rating is significantly below the average challenge rating of the other monsters in the group unless you think the weak monsters significantly contribute to the difficulty of the encounter.<br><br><h5>Encounter Multipliers</h5><table><thead><tr><td>Number of Monsters</td><td>Multiplier</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>x 1</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>x 1.5</td></tr><tr><td>3-6</td><td>x 2</td></tr><tr><td>7-10</td><td>x 2.5</td></tr><tr><td>11-14</td><td>x 3</td></tr><tr><td>15 or more</td><td>x 4</td></tr></tbody></table><br><strong><em>5. Compare XP.</em></strong> Compare the monsters' adjusted XP value to the party's XP thresholds. The closest threshold that is lower than the adjusted XP value of the monsters determines the encounter's difficulty.<br><br>For example, an encounter with one bugbear and three hobgoblins has an adjusted XP value of 1,000, making it a hard encounter for a party of three 3rd-level characters and one 2nd-level character (which has a hard encounter threshold of 825 XP and a deadly encounter threshold of 1,400 XP).<br><br><h4>Party Size</h4>The preceding guidelines assume that you have a party consisting of three to five adventurers.<br><br>If the party contains fewer than three characters, apply the next highest multiplier on the Encounter Multipliers table.

In this handout are also Macros for GMs to add to their game as they see fit. Be sure to check the specific linked handout for random encounters each set of random encounters for any additional information. <br><br>There is a rollable table for random encounters on <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=Nzc3NWM1MTU0ZmYw ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>The Sea of Moving Ice</a> while searching for <a class=\"entity-link\" data-entity=JournalEntry data-id=ZDQ5OWE4ZTYzZDEz ><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i>Oyaviggaton</a>, but it has limited functionality due to how encounters are structured in that part of the adventure. We also have a macro for choosing which encounter to use from the table in the text.

However, rolling this way always displays this roll to players.</li><li>Rolling using a macro allows you to roll so only the DM can see the results of the roll. These macros also will roll to see if an encounter occurs as a whisper to the DM.</li></ul>The included code for macros will only display to the DM.
